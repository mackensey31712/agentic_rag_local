The VCC is cloud-based software provided as a service for creating and managing outbound and inbound contact center operations:

l In outbound campaigns, the automatic dialer can make multiple simultaneous

calls. The dialer can skip busy signals, answering and fax machines, and no answer calls. Agents process calls answered only by a live person.

l In inbound campaigns, callers dial directly to the VCC which automatically routes

calls to agents based the campaign settings, such as skills and status.

The applications correspond to the user roles:

l Administrators configure and manage your Five9 contact center.

l Supervisors monitor and manage agents and campaigns, and view real-time

statistics for contact center operations.

l Agents use the Internet to connect to the VCC from anywhere in the world so

Accessing the Application During Domain Maintenance

Accessing the Application During Domain Maintenance

If your company uses the Five9 Managed Geographic Redundancy (MGR) feature, and you are logged into your Five9 application when maintenance is required or an outage occurs, your Five9 server is moved to a backup data center. Administrators, supervisors, and agents receive notices about the status of server changes during the switchover process.

Managing Maintenance Moves

During a major service disruption, Five9 may move your application server to a backup data center until the issue is resolved.

Five9 MGR is designed to mitigate major service disruptions that might otherwise result in extended downtime for the Five9 Virtual Contact Center (VCC) platform. Domains are typically operational in the backup data center within 15 minutes.

Once service is restored in the primary domain, Five9 returns affected domains to their primary data center.

Messaging for Domains with Managed Geographic Redundancy

Users who are logged in at the time an outage occurs see messages when maintenance is about to begin. At five minutes and one minute before a data center move, agents on active calls receive additional reminders. Agents who are processing calls are allowed to finish the call and assign a disposition. As soon as the interaction is complete, they are reconnected to their Five9 agent application in the backup data center.

Applications and softphone stations are restarted automatically. Agents receive audible and visual confirmations upon reconnection and their status is set to Ready so that they can resume taking calls.

However, Five9 Global Voice enables you to have the best quality calls and to have regional agents support local customers and is PCI compliant. You can set skills, IVR scripts, and inbound and outbound campaigns for regional call traffic handled by local agents. You can also configure uninterrupted coverage across multiple time zones and provide overflow call support during peak call conditions.

Domain Settings

The settings that you define for a domain are considered default because they apply to all campaigns in your domain. When you display the settings of a campaign, default is indicated in the definitions table. If you change settings and dispositions in a campaign, these new settings override your default domain settings, for example: two campaigns have a disposition named Call back later. In one campaign, the redial timer disposition is set to call back after seven days according to the default settings. To override the default domain setting, you set the callback to occur after 14 days in the other campaign.

Managing Do Not Call (DNC) Lists

If you conduct outbound telemarketing campaigns, you may want to add an in-house or local DNC list to your domain so that as the dialer processes phone numbers, it automatically checks your DNC list. If a number is found in the list, it is not dialed.

However, your local DNC list is not intended to replace national or regional DNC lists. Before importing call lists into Five9, always check your lists against the proper state or national Do Not Call registry. Suppliers, such as Contact Center Compliance, provide these services.

When your account is set up, the DNC list is empty. You can populate the list by importing a list of numbers, assigning a specific disposition, and using the Set DNC module in your IVR scripts.

Using DNC Lists

Numbers that you want to import into a list or remove from a list must be in TXT format files that contain a single column of phone numbers without any additional characters.

Managing Do Not Call (DNC) Lists

The time to process a list depends on the size of the list. When the process is finished, you see the results. The options are located in the Actions menu.

Because of the large file size of many lists, Five9 limits importing lists to the hours of 11:00 PM to 6:00 AM Pacific Time. Note that Pacific Time can be either Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) or Pacific Standard Time (PST), whichever is set on your domain.

If you try to import files outside these hours, you receive an error message.

You can add five or fewer numbers to the DNC list outside the restricted hours directly from the Contacts folder. To add numbers, select up to five numbers and right-click to access the options menu.

Managing Automatic Number Identification (ANI)

Automatic Number Identification (ANI) allows call recipients to see the phone number from which their call is originating. Set and manage the default Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and ANIs for local presence.

Default ANI

FCC and Telemarketing regulations require that you set a valid default ANI number for your domain. It is also required by Five9 for you to start any campaign. If you leave the default ANI blank, you see an error message when starting an outbound campaign or making an outbound manual call. The ANI tells the call recipients what telephone number made the call. The number appears in the caller ID displayed for outbound calls from your domain.

If you have an inbound number assigned to you by Five9, you may use that one, your main office line, or even a mobile phone number. For inbound campaigns, you can use the phone number assigned to that campaign as your default ANI. Be sure to set up the inbound campaign and test it before you try to use it as your default ANI. The default ANI must conform to these requirements:

l Must be reachable by your Five9 inbound campaigns.

l Must give callers an IVR DNC Opt Out option or an agent.

l Must accept callbacks for any outbound or dialed manual calls made from your

campaigns.

l Can be superseded by a campaign profile settlings or Local ANI groups in other

settings and configuration.

l Satisfies the minimum requirement in case other settings are not used.

Local ANIs

This section describes how to associate the displayed outgoing phone numbers (ANIs) and the area codes of the outbound calls. This feature enables you to display ANI numbers for return calls that are local to your contacts. Calls to area codes that are not mapped use the ANI set in the campaign profile or your domain’s default ANI number. See Managing Automatic Number Identification (ANI).

You can create multiple ANI groups. An ANI group is a set of ANI-to-area-code associations. For each ANI group, only one ANI may be assigned to a prefix. Multiple prefixes may be assigned to each ANI. One ANI that is assigned to multiple area codes counts as multiple ANI-to-area-code associations.

Depending on your business requirements, choose FTP, FTPs, or FTPes. FTP is adequate if the path to the storage location for the recordings is already encrypted, such as when the location is at your site and you have implemented a VPN. Otherwise, to protect recordings in transit, Five9 recommends SFTP. The configuration for each option is similar, except that with SFTP, you can upload an optional security key file. If you intend to use a key, you must obtain a private key file from your SFTP server administrator before starting configuration. For more information on keys, see Creating Public and Private Keys.

Exporting Recordings and Transcripts

You can record agent calls. Each recorded call is stored in a single file in WAV format. The recordings are stored for 30 days in the properties of the agent’s account (see Managing User Recordings). If you have an FTP server, recordings can be transferred daily to your server.

You can choose to store your recordings at your regional telephony Point of Presence (PoP) rather than a Five9 data center that may be located outside of your region. For more information about this feature for your domain, contact your Five9 representative.

You can also configure FTP settings for each campaign. The campaign FTP settings override the settings on the VCC Configuration page. To configure the campaign, see the Campaign Administrator's Guide, Outbound Campaign Properties.

The maximum length for call recordings is one hour for each call. To increase the maximum length up to three hours, contact your Five9 support representative.

By default, the number of simultaneous call recordings is limited to 20% of the provisioned agent seats. When calls are flagged, they are recorded if a port is available. You can transfer recordings of agent calls daily.

Advanced Recording Upload (ARU) replaces standard Recording Upload. It contains more advanced features, such as stitching call segments, rules-based upload with flexible criteria, and multiple FTP upload locations. The Advanced Recordings tab is visible only if this option is enabled for your domain. For more information, contact your Five9 representative.

You may define rules to specify the parameters and options for uploading recordings, voicemail messages, and IVR inputs. You can define up to five upload destinations for each rule. When you configure your rules in Advanced Recording Upload, you can pause the uploads until you have completed the configuration. Completed rules are uploaded once you resume uploads.

If you are changing from standard to advanced recording upload, you may run both at the same time, but you should do so only to verify that recordings are uploaded as expected. To verify the upload status of the recordings, use the Recording Log report.

To ensure that your recordings are reliably transferred, select the appropriate transfer method and destination for your business:

o Amazon S3: If your contact center has 25 or more agents, select

this protocol because bandwidth, ports, and performance monitoring are handled by the vendor.

o FTP methods: To ensure that you have sufficient resources and

monitoring to manage the recording upload, consult your FTP administrator.

o Google Drive: This option if meant for small office and home

office operations. Although Google offers account with various storage amounts, Five9 does not recommend this option for businesses that have more than a few agents.

5 Configure the protocol that you selected.

Setting KPI Parameters

This section is optional. To customize some of the service level statistics available in the Supervisor application and in reports, set limits in the KPI tab. To use default values, click Default at the bottom of the KPI window.

In reports, the service level is calculated for each call whether or not the service level was met. Service levels are expressed as percentages.

Setting KPI Parameters

Defining Service Level

Setting the Speed of Answer Threshold (seconds). This threshold value determines the service level for a call. If you want calls to be answered within 30 seconds, set the threshold value to 30. The default value is 20 seconds.

For inbound calls, the speed of answer is the interval between the call entering an ACD queue and being connected to an agent. Service level is measured by comparing the speed of answer (SOA) value to the threshold value. Service level is boolean and set as follows:

l 1: SOA <= SOA threshold; the agent answered the call in time.

l 0: SOA > SOA threshold; the agent did not answer the call before the threshold. Calls that are disconnected while in the queue for less than the threshold value are excluded.

Setting the Speed of Answer Minimum Time (seconds). Calls shorter than this setting, such as abandoned calls and wrong numbers, are excluded from statistics. This parameter is not used in outbound campaigns because these campaigns do not use the ACD. The default value is five seconds.

Including queue callback wait time in SL/SOA calculation. When enabled, waiting time for queue callback is included in the service level calculation that is shown in reports and Supervisor Plus applications. This option is disabled by default.

Examples This topic describes how service level is calculated in different scenarios. For inbound examples, the speed of answer and the minimum call length are set. For outbound calls, the speed to answer is set. In all cases, statistics are calculated for one hour, for example: 1:00 – 1:59 PM. Abandoned calls are excluded from calculations. Statistics are specific to either inbound or outbound calls. Statistics for calls that are answered must have talk time.

Note: The abandon rate 2-second rule calculation option allows you to use a queue time of 2 seconds or higher to identify outbound calls as abandoned. The Outbound Campaign Abandon Rate % 2 Seconds Rule standard report shows these values.

Inbound Queues. Speed of answer for the queue measures how fast the agent answers the call. This formula calculates the percentage of calls in a queue that met the service level because they were answered before the speed of answer threshold.

l 120 calls in the queue.

l 120 - 20 = 100 calls in the queue for longer than five seconds count towards the

service level agreement.

l 50 calls were answered in fewer than 15 seconds.

Inbound Talk Time. Speed of answer for talk time measures how fast the agent handles the call to resolve the customer’s problem (was talk time shorter or greater than minimum time?). This formula calculates the percentage of calls that met the service level because they were answered within the specified speed of answer and lasted longer than the minimum set call duration.

l 120 calls in the queue.

l 20 calls were considered abandoned because their duration was shorter than

the five-second set minimum.

l 120 - 20 = 100 calls in the queue count towards the service level agreement if

they are answered before the speed of answer threshold.

Defining the Maximum Number of Outbound Lines

When all outbound lines are in use by campaigns, agents may encounter problems when attempting to make transfers, callbacks, manual calls, or outbound calls. To avoid this problem, reduce the maximum number of lines used for automated campaign calls to save outbound lines (100% minus the configured setting) for other activities.

This setting reduces the number of lines which may be used by outbound campaigns in predictive, power, or progressive dialing modes, and by autodial campaigns. Preview dialing campaigns, third-party transfers, and manual calls associated with campaigns share the defined outbound line utilization percentage.

The number of reserved lines is rounded to the nearest whole number, and the effective maximum number of maximum lines for automated dialing is shown to the right of the percentage setting. If the total number of provisioned outbound lines for the account changes in the future, the maximum number of lines for automated dialing is automatically reduced or increased.

For more information, see Assigning Users to Queues. When agents are available, interactions are distributed by using queue priority. Use this task distribution to have tasks assigned to your agents for which they are the most skilled. Tasks are distributed by using these criteria, in the following order:

1 Queue rotation is used for multiple queues waiting for the same skill level. Tasks

are distributed in consecutive order: Sales - Skill Level_1, Support -Skill Level_1, ...Queue_N-Skill Level_1. Agent skill level is distributed in ascending order. Call#1 has been waiting the longest for the highest skill level and is delivered first. 2 Queue order in agent skills list. This queue order determines the queue rotation

described in step 1. 3 Task priority is distributed in descending order. Higher priority tasks are

distributed first, after skill level distribution is considered.

o Task priority, in descending order, is secondary in this selection.

o Queues are chosen consecutively in this selection.

o Call#5 is the second call delivered.

o Call#2 and Call#6 are each waiting for the highest skill level and are

distributed in order of queue priority, consecutively. 4 Waiting time is considered only after agent skill level and task priority and is

distributed in descending order.

o Consecutive queue selection continues for skill level = 1.

o Call#3 and Call#4 are waiting for skill level = 2 and are distributed to an

available agent after all calls for skill level = 1 are distributed. Task Priority. When no agents are available, interactions with the highest priority among all queues are assigned to agents. Use this distribution to distribute tasks in order of business value, or task priority, while still considering the agent skill level and skills list order. Tasks are distributed using the following criteria, in this order:

Queue rotation is used for tasks waiting for the same skill level. 3 Queue Rotation: Queue rotation order is related to skill configuration, not

necessarily to any display order. 4 Waiting Time: After task priority, agent skill level, and queue rotation are

considered, tasks are distributed in descending order of longest waiting time. Task Longest Wait Time. When no agents are available, interaction priority increases with the waiting time. Use this task distribution when all tasks are of equal business value and queue priority or agent skill level are not a consideration. Tasks are distributed purely by task waiting time.

1 Distribution order is FIFO (first in, first out) across all queues. 2 Task priority and agent skill level are ignored by the ACD. 3 Queue order in agent skills list is ignored by the ACD. 4 Task priority that is set in the campaign profile and increased or decreased in the

Graceful Agent State Transition Delay

This feature is a global setting that applies to outbound campaigns running in predictive, power, or progressive mode that are used in Agent Desktop Plus and Plus CRM integrations.

## Page 117

Domain Settings

Defining Global Campaign Settings

Dialing Process The dialer makes calls based on the number of agents in ready state in each running campaign. Therefore, when agents change to Not Ready, the number of calls made by the dialer exceeds the number of agents available to receive the calls. As a result, some calls may be abandoned. If too many calls are abandoned, compliance issues may occur.

Transition Delay You can set a 1- to 59-second delay that is applied when agents select Not Ready after setting a call disposition. During that interval, agents are placed in a pending Not Ready state. In their application, agents can see that they are still ready to accept calls, but these options are disabled:

l Making manual calls and callbacks

l Manually answering outbound calls

The dialer continues to route the outbound calls that were already dialed to the original number of agents. Agents in pending Not Ready state receive only these outbound calls already in transit, but the dialer will not place additional calls for these

Configuring International Service with Five9 Global Voice

Five9 Global Voice provides international calling with regionally specific skills, IVR scripts, and campaigns configured to provide continuous coverage and/or additional agent capacity for overflow coverage. Domains configured for international dialing may be further subdivided into regional contact centers using Five9 Global Voice. Five9 Global Voice currently consists of four regions: Brazil, Ireland, Japan, and Australia. Calls that originate in one global region and end in another region are subject to latency, which introduces call quality problems, such as long delays. You can save your recordings to a Global Voice Point of Presence (PoP) so that your recordings stay in your geographic region.

Configuring International Service with Five9 Global Voice

Planning Your Five9 Global Voice Implementation

To determine your specific use and needs, the following guidance is offered.

Understanding Your Call Patterns When planning your contact center, be sure to optimize your calling patterns to eliminate these delays. International dialing is augmented by defining calling regions to subdivide your global coverage service area. Segmenting your call patterns to identify local, or regional, calling areas also helps to overcome any latency issues often associated with international dialing.

Determining Your Business Needs A best practice is to classify your calls by region, which means that you route calls to the agents nearest to the call origin or termination. For example, your callers from Japan would talk to agents in Japan, and your Australia region callers talk to agents in Australia. To accomplish this, you need local numbers, regional station IDs, and campaigns configured to route regions calls to local numbers.

Planning for Overflow Call Traffic To accommodate peak hours, off hours, and business continuity, you may want agents in one region to back up agents in another region for uninterrupted support or overflow calls. You can define an alternate region as a backup for your excess call traffic. For example, 100 Japanese-speaking agents can process from Japan while 10 Japanese-speaking agents in Australia are available to receive calls when all agents in Japan are busy. To reduce call delays, remember the distance that the voice must travel.

Five9 Global Voice Requirements

Contact your Five9 representative to determine your specific needs and readiness for Five9 Global Voice.

Requirement Description Domain Must be enabled for your domain.

After your domain is enabled for international dialing and has been assigned regional Station IDs, configure your domain for in-region calling.

Note

To easily identify your global agents, queues, IVRs, and campaigns, Five9 recommends that you add the region to the naming convention, for example: JPN_username and AUS_region.

1 Assign regional station IDs to the agents in your defined regions to staff your

campaigns and support your call patterns.

For example, define agents that will connect to Sydney, Tokyo, or both regions.

2 Create campaigns and campaign profiles for specific regions.

See Managing Automatic Number Identification (ANI).

3 Assign the new regional IDID or ITFN to these campaigns.

Using WebRTC for Audio Communication

If your domain is enabled for WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), your Five9 Plus applications users can establish audio communication through their browser with no need to install a softphone or an extension. WebRTC station IDs are interchangeable with softphone station IDs. For example, if an agent connects using 5432 as their softphone station ID, that same station ID may be used when that agent connects using WebRTC.

Citrix or VMWare) to run applications. You configure the softphone as part of the virtual setup on both the agent workstations and the virtual deployment infrastructure (the remote server). For more information on installing and managing the softphone in virtual desktop environments, see Virtual Desktop Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Option 1: Installing the Software on a Single Workstation The simplest method to deploy the softphone is for agents and supervisors to install the browser extension and softphone on their own workstations. Alternately, IT or supervisors can install the browser extension and softphone on each workstation.

Note

When installing the softphone on a single workstation, Five9 recommends installing for all user accounts on the workstation (per machine). You can choose to install the softphone for the specific logged-in user (per user).

Step 1: Installing Browser Extensions

You must install the Five9 softphone browser extension before beginning softphone installation, except for the WebRTC softphone.

For detailed instructions, see:

l Installing Chrome or Edge Browser Extensions

l Installing Firefox Browser Extensions

Important: If you are prompted that the installer applet needs access to control the Finder app, select OK. The Five9 installer needs this permission to update the Home folder when installing the softphone for the logged-in user.

o For all users installs the softphone for all users on the workstation.

The macOS installer removes any currently installed softphones and installs the new version.

Option 2: Installing the Software in Group Deployment To ensure standard implementation across many workstations, administrators can deploy the browser extension and softphone across groups using automated methods.

Important

These instructions apply to using automation to deploy the software to user workstations. The process to deploy the software in a virtual desktop environment is similar, but the commands and parameters differ. For information on deploying the software in a virtual desktop environment, see the Virtual Desktop Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Considerations for Group Deployment

l If you use automation techniques to deploy the softphone using the command

line to users who have limited permission to update their workstation, the softphone will not automatically update when a new version is released. You must use automation to first uninstall the softphone for all users before deploying the new version. See Uninstalling the Five9 Softphone.

l Before using automation, ensure that you fully test the process to install and

uninstall using the command line.

l Five9 tests softphone installation with the command line. However, each

customer deployment using automated tools and scripts is unique. Five9 Customer Support can assist you with issues about the installer, but cannot support or troubleshoot your network or implementation.

Downloading Files

To download the softphone and browser extension files:

page.

b Make note of the extension ID in the URL:

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/five9- softphone-extension/<extensionID>

o For Firefox, select Firefox extension to download the Firefox extension

file.

4 Download the Windows or Mac softphone installer.

Installing the Browser Extension in Group Deployments

Before you deploy the softphone, you must install or deploy the install browser extensions. If the browser extension is not available when you deploy the softphone, your agents will receive a warning when they log in the first time after the installation. The warning directs users to contact their administrator to finish the installation.

This example illustrates deploying the Google Chrome browser extension using Microsoft's Group Policy Object (GPO). You can use similar methods to deploy other browser extensions or to deploy using other administration tools.

There are two options for deploying the Chrome browser extension:

l Installing as a force-installed extension prevents users from enabling or disabling

the browser extension in their browser.

l Installing using extension management settings gives users the option to enable

or disable the browser extension.

Follow these steps:

If the issue persists, see Using the Clean-Up Batch File to Remove Old Softphone Files.

Uninstalling the Five9 Softphone

Use these instructions to uninstall the softphone.

Considerations for Uninstalling the Softphone

l By default, the softphone installs with the auto-update feature enabled. The

softphone automatically updates on release of a new version.

l Agents and supervisors with write permission on their workstation do not need

to uninstall the current Five9 softphone on release of a new version. This is true regardless of whether the softphone was installed using the single workstation option or group deployment option.

l If agent and supervisor workstations are not configured with write permissions,

the softphone auto-update feature will not work. You must uninstall the softphone for all users on release of a new version. You can then deploy the new version regardless how the previous version was installed (single workstation or mass/group deployment)

Note: In some cases, new functionality in a softphone release may require that you uninstall the previous softphone from all workstations before installing the version. When that is required, Five9 will provide specific instructions.

Using the Clean-Up Batch File to Remove Old Softphone Files In some cases, repeated installation of the softphone on a workstation may leave obsolete entries in the Windows Registry. These obsolete entries may cause group deployment scripts to fail with a message, "Product already installed."

Five9 installs a batch file for removing the softphone files, folders, and registry entries from a workstation. The batch file is installed in the %TEMP% folder of the workstation.

The clean-up batch file does the following.

l Stops any running softphone processes.

l Removes Five9 softphone folders.

141 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

l Removes Five9 softphone entries from the Windows Registry.

You can run the batch file for the logged-in user (per user) or for all users on the workstation (per machine).

Note

When you uninstall the softphone using the MSI installer in a command line, the installer automatically executes the clean-up batch file to remove any obsolete files remaining on the workstation.

To run the clean-up batch file:

1 Open a command prompt with administrator privileges.

2 Change to the %TEMP% directory where the clean-up batch file was installed.

cd %TEMP%

3 Run the clean-up batch file:

o For all users on the workstation:

softphone-cleanup.bat ALLUSERS

o For a specific user on the workstation:

a Determine the security identifier (SID) of the user from which you

want to remove the softphone:

– Retrieve the SID of the logged-in user:

whoami /user

– Retrieve the SID of a specific user:

wmic useraccount where Name='{username}' get SID

b Enter the following command.

softphone-cleanup.bat {username} {SID}

Option 1: Uninstalling from a Single Workstation To uninstall the softphone on a workstation, use Windows Control Panel or use the following commands in a command prompt.

Note: For information on updating the softphone in virtual desktop environments, see Virtual Desktop Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Updating the Five9 Softphone for a New Release

Automatic Softphone Installation

When Five9 releases a new version of the softphone, the new version automatically installs the next time the agent logs into their station. If there is an issue with the updated softphone, update messages may display in the browser on log in. Any failure in the migration to the new softphone requires manual installation. See Installing the Five9 Softphone.

Note: To manually install the update, Windows users must first uninstall the Five9 softphone through Settings > Apps.

Important: Security software may prevent automatic softphone updates. In this case, the softphone must be manually installed.

Softphone updates happen in the background at the agent’s next login. If any failure occurs during the download or unpacking of the softphone update, this process repeats at the next login attempt until successful. The next agent login presents the new softphone version.

Note

If the agent has the User Cannot Install Softphone permission enabled in their user properties, a Contact Your IT message displays.

Updating the Softphone Manually To manually install the update, Windows users must first uninstall the old softphone version using the command line:

Queues contain the interactions that agents can process and the tasks that agents can perform in a campaign. In the Skills tab of the agent’s properties, you assign queues to the agent. The Level option represents the priority of the queue for this agent. Level 1 is the highest priority. Different agents may be assigned the same queues, but the priority for each agent may be different. For example, when interactions are routed to agents who are assigned the same queues, agents who have the highest Level (priority) may receive interactions first, depending on the distribution method that is selected. Note that other factors can affect how interactions are routed. For a description of these factors, see Setting the Distribution of Interactions.

For each user, you can define the allowed types of interactions. Depending on their assigned skills, agents can interact with your customers through voice and any combination of text channels. Agents respond to incoming requests coming from email, chat, or social tools, such as Facebook and Twitter. Text channels are available only with inbound campaigns. Voice interactions can be configured for inbound and

outbound campaigns. If your domain is enabled for Five9 Engagement Workflow, this media type panel also enables you to select Salesforce Chat and Case media types for interaction routing.

Important

To route Salesforce cases to agents, enable Chat and Case media types.

If your contact center uses text channels in addition to voice, specify which of the channels each agent can use and the maximum number (Max Allowed) for each type of interaction that the agent can have at any time. In this example, the agent is allowed to engage in all media channels.

If Intelligent Routing is enabled, incoming requests are automatically presented to the agent to accept or reject until the specified maximum number is reached. If Intelligent Routing is disabled, the agent can select interactions manually (or cherry pick) from the queue. In this example, Social is not enabled so the agent may select a new social request from the media queue if the agent has not reached the task limit.

Resetting PINs

When you access voicemail through your phone, a secure Personal Identification Number (PIN) is required to access the voicemail storage box. The PIN is a string that can contain up to eight digits ["0. . 9"]. The field is empty for new users. Agents can set or change their PIN only by calling a dedicated phone number. The extension number and the PIN enable agents to listen their new and saved messages.

l In the navigation pane, right-click Users, and select Reset Pin.

l Alternately, you can set the PIN in the Voicemail tab of the User Properties

screen. Click Reset Pin in the Voicemails tab of the user properties. See also

Managing Voicemail Greetings

A greeting is a message that is played to callers when a call is redirected to the voice mailbox because the agent did not answer. Greetings can be configured for skill and personal messages. For more information about skill mailbox greetings, see Managing Skill Voicemail Greetings.

If your agents have a personal voice mailbox, you may upload a personalized greeting for each agent to replace the default greeting. Five9 recommends that you use personalized greetings if you transfer calls directly to agents in your IVR scripts or if agents transfer calls to other agents. Agents can record their greetings by calling a number added by the administrator to the campaign and may upload custom greetings.

Managing Skill Voicemail Messages

Managing Skill Voicemail Messages

Voicemail is used to transfer and store telephone messages to agents and or skill groups. Each skill group can be configured to receive messages. Administrators and supervisors also have access to the skill messages. Voicemail files are transferred to users by using Java RMI, which is securely encrypted.

Typical skill messages originate from IVR modules (Voicemail Transfer or Skill Transfer), internal calls to a skill group when no agents are available, and transferred personal or other skill group messages.

Skill messages are delivered only to agents who have permissions to process them and whose status is VMReady. Administrators may give to agents these permissions:

l User Can Process Skill Voicemails

l User Can Delete Skill Voicemail Messages

l User Can Transfer Skill Voicemail Messages Supervisors can monitor the distribution of messages. They may also force agents to be ready or not ready to receive messages.

Messages are delivered to agents only if Route Voicemails for This Skill is enabled in the skill properties. If this option is disabled, the skill group accumulates messages, but they are not routed to agents. In this case, only administrators and supervisors can process the messages.

Note

If Route Voicemails for This Skill is enabled in the Voicemail Actions tab, changes might overlap while messages are routed to agents.

Audio Files for Agent Use

Audio files can be used by agents for things such as playing a legal disclaimer that must be read precisely or leaving a message on an answering machine. You can add up to 20 files to a skill as files available for agent use.

Audio Files for Whisper Announcement

An audio file may be used for call announcement, otherwise known as whisper, that is played on call connection. These whisper announcements prepare the agent for what type call is arriving, such as "Sales call" or "Support call". Only one whisper prompt may be associated to a skill; a whisper prompt associated to a skill overrides a whisper prompt set at the campaign level.

A call list is a list of records from your contact database. Call lists are used for dialing phone numbers in outbound and autodial campaigns.

Although a contact record may be added to the Virtual Contact Center (VCC) without being added to a list, a list record cannot be added to a list without also adding a corresponding contact record.

Every contact record includes a number of default contact fields, for example:

l Primary number (number1)

l Alternate number 1 (number2)

l Alternate number 2 (number3)

l First name

l Last name A contact record must have at least one valid phone number and you may store up to three phone numbers for a contact (fields number1, number2, or number3 of the contact record). You can create custom contact fields. For more information, see Managing Contact Fields.

You access Call lists by selecting Lists in the navigation pane. All available call lists appear in the main pane.

Updating Call Lists for Telemarketing Campaigns

You can add, update, rename, and remove call lists. You can update a call list manually, by importing a file, or using an API. You can schedule list updates by pulling lists from an FTP server. Updating a list may create or update contact records in the contact database.

You can organize your lists in any order prior to uploading. Unless a different sort order is specified in a campaign profile, the system follows this order while dialing these records for the first time. By default, the dialer processes a list in the uploaded order of the records.

Disposition settings, campaign profiles, and other options may affect the dialing order of list records. The List Dialing Mode option in campaign properties defines how the dialer handles the dialing process. You can use a campaign profile to change the dialing order of a call list based on any of the contact fields or filter list records that are dialed in a campaign by adding filters. See Filtering Contacts.

You can use work flow rules to automatically reset the dial position to the top of the list based on specified conditions, or manually reset the dial position by right-clicking on the outbound or autodial campaign and selecting Reset List Position.

Updating Call Lists for Telemarketing Campaigns

Important

For telemarketing campaigns, you are required to check each list against the appropriate Do Not Call lists before you import a list into Five9.

221 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 224

Call Lists

Managing the Size of Lists

Lists are not automatically checked against your domain’s DNC List during the upload process. Phone numbers in a list are checked against your local DNC list before they are dialed. See also Managing Do Not Call (DNC) Lists.

Managing the Size of Lists

When lists are very large, sorting and dialing automatically can slow down list processing. The dialing queue is limited to 20 concurrent calls. If you do not sort the list, the maximum suggested number of records is 500,000. If you sort the list by using more than one field, Five9 recommends that the list not exceed 10,000 records. Smaller lists are quicker to upload; campaigns start faster.

You can process your list for upload at any time. Files larger than 50,000 records will upload in 50,000 increments in the background. Five9 processes 50,000 records from each file in the job queue before returning for another 50,000 records. This is to make certain that upload speeds are not compromised and that all jobs have enough numbers to begin any production campaign. This may cause interruptions to running campaigns as additional 50,000 row increments are uploaded.

To maximize performance, periodically remove from the list all records that are not new or in progress. When records from a list, proceed as follows to avoid losing data:

Prepare a custom report of the leads that you want to remove from the list.

1 Transfer those leads by FTP to a local server. 2 Delete the data from the list. For more information on removing records from lists, see Removing Records and Call Lists.

Understanding Field Mapping and Unique Keys

A list that you import may contain duplicate records, and duplicate records may already exist in your contact database. The same contact may appear in multiple lists, so you can have multiple records for the same contact.

If a contact was entered into the database with the same unique key, that one record can point to multiple lists. The unique key enables you to identify and remove duplicate

records so that each record is unique. Records are considered duplicates if the unique key matches more than one contact record.

You set the unique key in the field mapping step of the update wizard.

l In the Basic mode, the unique key is Number1 (primary phone number). When

you encounter duplicates during updates, only the first duplicate record is processed.

1 Basic mode

l In the Advanced mode, the unique key can be set to one or more contact fields.

The default unique key is Number1+ first_name + last_name. However, in outbound campaigns, you might prefer to use an account number or email address. When multiple contact fields are selected as the key, all fields must match for two contact records to be considered duplicates. . To dial multiple contacts at the same phone number, choose a unique key other than only the phone number, such as the first and last names. In this case, the key might be number1+ first_name + last_name.

The most common format for a list is comma-separated values (CSV) list. The other supported options for delimiters are colon, semicolon, or a custom delimiter.

The phone number can contain special characters, such as spaces, dashes, and parentheses, but should be limited to ten digits. For example, (925) 555-1212 is valid, but (925) 555-1212 x123 is not.

International Dialing If you are dialing international numbers from either the U.S. or Canada, include the exit code 011 in front of each number. The international phone numbers are between 10 and 20 digits long. The format is 011 + country code + phone number.

All phone numbers must be entered into lists by using the format in which all numbers begin with a plus (+) sign. Numbers can contain up to 15 digits, not including the plus (+) sign.

The VCC dialer automatically includes the plus (+) sign for all outbound calls; the plus (+) sign signals to the carrier that an international number follows, an standard call possibly to another nation without needing to include the originating country's prefix.

If you have lists which are not currently in format, you must convert them before you attempt to use them.

Importing and Updating Call Lists

Outbound Telemarketing If you are conducting outbound cold-call telemarketing, you might need to check your lists against the appropriate state or national Do Not Call lists before you import them into your Virtual Contact Center (VCC).

Note

While Five9 makes no specific recommendations, compliance vendors can assist with list scrubs. For more information, see suppliers, such as Contact Center Compliance.

Preparing Your Call List for Importing

1 Open your list in a spreadsheet application.

2 Be sure your list has a row of column headings.

You may also use source files without column headings. In this case, in the Field Mapping step of the List Update Wizard, do not check Has Header. For files without column headings and when scheduling list updates, use column numbers to map fields.

3 If your list contains fields that are not associated with contact field, add the new

field (see Managing Contact Fields).

The field must exist before importing the file, but the names of columns in your file do not need to match the names of corresponding fields in the VCC. If you have fields in your list that you do not want to import into Five9, you can ignore them during the import process.

4 Check the phone number field and other fields for commas.

If your list shows zero records after the import, the phone number field may not formatted properly, or one of the fields contains a comma.

5 Check your data:

o If the system encounters duplicate records and invalid phone numbers

during the update process, all records may not be imported. Therefore, the VCC list may show fewer records than your original list.

o The system does not import numbers with fewer than 10 digits and

numbers that begin with a 1.

6 Delete any blank columns in the list, unless the blank column is needed.

7 After you import the list, apply a dialing order by using campaign profiles.

Importing a List from a CSV File

Use this method if you already have a list of numbers in a comma-separate file.

1 Right-click a call list, and select Update List.

2 In the wizard, select your List Update options.

o Type of Update: Add records to list

New contact records are added if records matching the key fields do not already exist in your contacts. Existing records are also updated with information in your source file. Disabling this option allows only existing contact records that match the values in the key fields to be added to the list. Records with keys that do not match existing records are not added to the list or Contacts.

o Mode: Basic Mode

One record for each primary number. Use only if your contacts have unique primary numbers (number1 field).

– Records with keys that do not match records in your contact are added to your list and to the database. – Records with keys that match existing records in your contact are updated with the information in the source file. If multiple matches occur in your contact, only the matching record that was created first is updated.

o Mode: Advanced Mode

Multiple unique keys and manually set mapping. The Advanced Mode contains an additional step. The unique key of a record (field mapping step of the wizard) may be changed to any combination of contact fields.

If you enable Add records to list, disable Update Contact, and enable Advanced mode contacts are not updated. Instead, any records in the source file with keys that do not match any records are not added to the list or to your contacts. However, records with keys that match existing records are added to your list as they appear in your contacts.

This step appears only if you selected the Advanced mode.

3 Select your Record Update options:

o Add first (oldest) matching Contact Record to the list: Add only one

record to the list if multiple matches are found for a record in the contact.

o Add all matching Contact Records (in case of multiple records) to the

list: Add all matching records from the contact to the list.

o Skip record if multiple matches are found in Contact: If duplicate records

are found, skip the record and do not apply any changes to the record in the list. The match is based on the unique key defined on the next step.

o Delete all list records before update: Use this option to clear the list

before adding new records. This feature removes all records in the list before adding the new records. When enabling this option, reporting data about the deleted list records is lost.

4 Click Next to begin adding records.

o If you are using Advanced Mode, Add records to list, and Add/Update

Contact, you can select the action for contact update.

o If you are using the Basic mode, this step is not available.

5 Define how the records are updated:

To update records, you must check at least one box.

o Add new record if matching key is not found in Contact - new records are

added to your contacts if they are not already found.

o Update existing Contact record(s) with matching key - existing records are

updated with the data from the source file.

– First (oldest) matching record: Only the record that was created first is updated. – All matching records (in case of multiple matches): All matching records are updated. – Only if single match in Contact: Records are updated only if other matching records are not found.

o Action on data type format error: This setting determines how to treat

records with field values that do not conform to data types selected in the Contacts folder.

– Report as error and skip: The error is reported, and the record is skipped. – Leave field blank: The non-conforming field is left blank; the other fields of the contact record are added or updated.

6 Click Next to open the Contact Update screen.

7 Select either manual import or a file in CSV format.

o Manual import: to edit a number of existing fields or add a few records.

You can update the call list by manually entering data in the fields of the table.

o File in CSV format: to add or update large numbers of records. See also

Selected Items.

Selecting the Fields to Form the Unique Key The unique key identifies duplicate records in the contact database and in the list when importing a list. The key enables you to specify how duplicate records are identified.

When updating a contact or a list from a file that contains duplicate records, the first of these duplicate records are processed. Records are considered duplicates if the key matches more than one of the records in the file.

The unique key for outbound campaigns can be a phone number when you want to dial only one contact per number. However, for example, you can create a unique key by combining the phone number, first name, and last name.

To dial multiple contacts at the same phone number, the unique key must be something other than phone number, such as first and last names. Otherwise only one contact record for each phone number are added.

In the Key column, check the boxes next to the fields that you want to use as the unique key. In the Basic Mode, the number1 field is always selected as the key. You can select keys only in the Advanced Mode. By default, the number1, first_name, last_ name fields are selected keys.

Toll-Free Numbers and International Calls

The origin of your inbound calls determines the type of toll-free numbers that you need. Typically, toll-free numbers cannot receive inbound international calls. Some toll- free numbers are geographically specific; others are country specific.

l Universal International Freephone Numbers (UIFN) allow calls between

countries participating in the UIFN program. Currently, 65 countries participate.

l International Toll-free Freephone Numbers (ITFN) are country specific.

l Toll-free Numbers for U.S and Canada To receive calls from international callers, speak with your account representative about ordering local toll circuits at the Five9 data center:

l Order international toll service from other providers, such as Sprint, AT&T, and

MCI, which are forwarded to the Five9 toll circuit.

l Request that your international customers call you at a U.S. local number. With international calls, ANI delivery is not guaranteed. Generally only about 10% of calls placed or received internationally have a caller ID.

If an error message states that the billing ID cannot be found, you have dialed a number that is currently not supported by the VCC.

Because the Five9 VCC is located in the U.S., you must use the North America Numbering Plan for numbers outside the United States and Canada. International numbers contain a maximum 20 digits, for example: 01144207929476598

l U.S. international access code: 011

l Country code, such as 44

l National destination code, such as 207

l Subscriber number, such as 929476598

Convert your Call List to the Correct Format

If the numbers in your calls list include the country call-out code (011), and you are converting an existing list to conform to international number format, replace the call- out country code (011) with the plus (+) sign. numbers may contain up to 15 digits.

Note

Excel sometimes removes leading zeros (0). Be sure to check your numbers and replace them if necessary.

A disposition is used by agents to set the status or result of an interaction. Dispositions appear in reports. Two types of dispositions are open and closed. Both system and custom dispositions are available:

l System Dispositions - System dispositions are provided by Five9 to help you

improve the reporting results of your campaigns. You cannot remove or add system dispositions, but you can modify some of the parameters.

l Custom Dispositions - Created by you and assigned to campaigns by agents.

Custom dispositions can be added, changed, or removed. Each disposition may be configured with its own parameters. For example, you may configure a disposition so that Busy numbers are redialed at five-minute intervals for up to ten times.

For outbound campaigns, you can reset dispositions for numbers that have already been dialed. When deciding on dispositions for outbound campaigns, consider these categories:

l Successful Calls (sale, lead, application taken, appointment set)

l Negative Calls (not interested, hung up, add to DNC List)

l Unknown Result (call back scheduled, left message, recycle, answering machine) Inbound call dispositions depends on your business application. Start by creating a master list of dispositions for all campaigns. Then assign specific dispositions to campaigns from this list.

Redial Number Dispositions

With this option configured without a redial timer, the number is dialed again when the dialer completes the list and starts over from the top. The redial time is unpredictable because you do not know when the dialer completes the first pass through the list.

When using this option without a timer, the Minimum Duration Before Redialing Number setting in Campaign Properties applies. See also Number Redial Timeout (Campaigns).

However, you can specify the redial time by selecting Use redial timer and entering the time you want to wait before trying the number again. The system attempts to dial the number as soon as possible, after that time (without first waiting to pass through the rest of the list). You can also specify the maximum number of attempts for a number when this disposition is selected consecutively.

When using redial with a timer, the Minimum Duration Before Redialing Number setting in Campaign Properties is ignored, until the maximum number of redial attempts for the disposition is reached. You can set these additional parameters:

l Redial After (minutes) - The dialer redials the number as soon as possible after

the specified time.

l Number of Attempts - The dialer redials up to the value defined in Number of

Attempts if the same disposition is set sequentially.

l Allow Agents to Change Redial Time - Can be enabled only if Redial After is

enabled. In the Agent application, the disposition displays an additional menu to select a redial time. The time configured in the Redial After setting is also shown to Agents as the default option for this disposition. When an agent specifies a redial time, the phone number is redialed by the campaign at the designated time and the call is delivered to any available agent that is qualified for the campaign.

This feature is useful for outbound customers whose agents work in shifts, such as when agents in the morning shift need to schedule campaign-related callbacks for agents in the evening shift.

campaign Profiles count all attempts to any of a contact record’s numbers as a dial attempt, including redials due to disposition settings. The Campaign Profile Number of Attempts option overrides disposition counters, rather than work with them, in cases where the Campaign Profile option is set lower than a disposition option.

289 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 292

Dispositions

Types of Dispositions

The profile and disposition counters restrict dialing to individual numbers within a record, rather than to the entire record.

1 Redial Type

When using redial dispositions, consider these points:

l Numbers without a redial timer is considered for dialing by a campaign on next

cycle through the list.

l Number with a redial timer is dialed again after the time specified.

l If a number was assigned a disposition with a redial timer and the dialer reaches

the number again while making a new pass through the list BEFORE the redial time has been reached, it is not dialed. The number is redialed at the time specified in the disposition as opposed to the list.

l If a number receives the same Redial disposition consecutively, the dialer stops

attempts when the Number of Attempts has been reached.

l When using Redial with a redial timer, the alternate phone numbers for the

contact record are not dialed until this redial number is tried again. The concept is that we do not know the outcome of the original number yet, so we try it again first before attempting other numbers for the contact record.

l When using Redial without a redial timer, the alternate phone numbers for the

contact are dialed without waiting for the redial number to be tried again.

l If Allow Agents To Change Redial Time is selected, the redial timer set by agents

works in the same way and follows the same rules as the redial timer set by administrators.

Example

Redial without redial timer: the campaign starts at 10:00AM; records are dialed consecutively.

1 At 10:10AM, the campaign dials a number that is assigned a disposition

by a Redial Number disposition without a redial timer set.

2 By 2:00PM, the campaign has covered all records in the list. The first

cycle of dialing took 4 hours.

3 By 2:30PM, the campaign reaches again the number that was assigned a

disposition with a Redial Number disposition: the campaign attempts to dial the number again 4 hours 20 minutes after the first attempt.

1 Dial list (first pass) 2 Dial list (second pass)

Example

Redial with redial timer: the campaign starts at 10:00AM; records are dialed consecutively.

1 At 10:10AM, the campaign dials a number that was assigned a

disposition as Busy (the Busy system disposition is a Redial Number disposition with the Redial After = 5 minutes and the Number of Attempts = 5).

2 By 10:15AM, the campaign tries the number again (5 minutes after

receiving the original Busy disposition). It receives Busy again.

3 Four more attempts are made at 10:20AM, 10:25AM, 10:30AM, and

10:35AM. The number continues to be busy. The dialer stops dialing the number because the maximum number of attempts (5) has been

reached with this disposition.

Do Not Dial Number for Campaign Dispositions

The number is not dialed by the campaign, but other numbers from the contact record can be dialed unless the Apply to All Numbers in This Contact Record option is enabled. If the number is met in other contact records in the list, it can be dialed without restrictions.

1 DND Type

This type of disposition has three options:

l Apply to All Numbers in This Contact Record - If enabled, the dialer restricts all

the contact record’s numbers from being dialed, not only the number for which the disposition was set.

l Use Timer To Reactivate Number - The dialer does not dial the number in the

current campaign. When this option is checked, you can set the additional parameter Activate After and set the time. This parameter means that the number becomes available again for dialing after the activation time. When using the Activate After selection, the number is dialed on the next pass through the list, assuming the activation time elapsed.

292 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 295

Dispositions

Types of Dispositions

l Allow Agents to Change Reactivation Time - Can only be turned on if the Use

Timer to Reactivate Number option is enabled. For the agent, the disposition enables an additional menu to select a reactivation time. The time configured in the Activate After setting is also shown to agents as the default option for this disposition. When an agent specifies a reactivation time, the phone number is reactivated by the campaign at the designated time and the dialer may later deliver the call to any available agent that is qualified for the campaign.

Example

Without an activation timer: A record contains three numbers. The first number is assigned a do-not-dial disposition. Because every contact record can have up to three numbers to dial, the other two numbers can still be dialed. However, if Apply to All Numbers in This Contact Record is enabled, none of the numbers can be dialed.

Example

With an activation timer: A called party asks not to be called again for at least 2 hours. The dialer considers the number on next pass in 1.5 hours but does not call, as this is before the 2-hour timer has expired. The next pass is in 3 hours. The number is redialed in 3 hours.

The vertical dialing mode does not wait until the next pass through the list to check if the timer has expired. The vertical dialing mode emulates a redial timer and redials the record when the time has expired, regardless of list position.

Final Disposition For Contact Record Dispositions

When you apply a final disposition, the contact record, including alternate phone numbers, is not dialed again by the campaign. A final decision has been made, such as Application taken or Not interested.

This type of disposition has one option: Apply To Campaigns Using This Disposition. When this option is enabled, the contact record is not dialed in any campaign that

Types of Dispositions

contains this disposition. A final disposition can be applied to multiple campaigns when the other campaigns are using this same disposition.

Campaigns that were created after a final disposition with the Apply To Campaigns Using This Disposition enabled was assigned to a contact record may still attempt to dial this contact record if the record exists in any lists assigned to the new campaign.

Note: If the disposition is set to Final Disposition and if "Apply to Campaigns Using This Disposition" is enabled, the option "Apply to Campaigns Using This Disposition" does not work in the Campaign Profile Disposition menu. The disposition must be added to the Campaign Properties for "Apply to Campaigns Using This Disposition" to work.

Add Number To DNC List Dispositions

When using the Add Number to DNC List option, the customer's individual number or entire contact record is placed in the local Do Not Call list for the domain.

The option to assign only the contacted phone number can be used for cases when only one or two of a customer’s phone numbers (for example, work or cell) should be avoided.

Example

A called party asked for one or all phone numbers to not be called again. There are the following options:

l Add Active Number - Adds only the current number (the number dialed)

to the DNC list. Other numbers for the contact record can still be dialed.

l Add Active Number and Finalize Record for Campaign - Adds the current

number and makes the record final for the campaign. This option stops dialing this record for this campaign but does not add the contact’s

Dispositions

Types of Dispositions

other phone numbers to the DNC list. This option allows you to dial the other numbers from another campaign.

l Add All Numbers and Finalize Record for Campaign - Adds all phone

numbers for the contact record to the DNC list. This option prevents dialing to any of the contact’s phone numbers from any campaign.

Digital Channel Disposition Types

Digital channel dispositions allow an agent to select a disposition on interactions, such as chat or email interactions, without closing the text interaction. This has no impact on voice calls.

Important

Digital channel disposition types cannot be changed once they have been saved.

Global Dispositions

You can create unified dispositions to use globally for text channel and voice interactions. These dispositions can be defined as open, enabling your agents to track the status of an interaction without closing that interaction, or closed to assign the final result of that interaction. This is different from voice channel dispositions, which are always closed.

Example

You can create a disposition named Waiting for Status that can be applied to an email interaction when the agent is waiting for a customer reply.

System Dispositions

Generally, system dispositions are used by the dialer to generate a report on dialing activity and control the dialing process. System dispositions have the same options and properties as the custom dispositions, but some options and properties cannot be changed. System dispositions cannot be created, deleted, or renamed.

Email notification and instant messages are available for most system dispositions. Reporting Call Variable configuration is available for all dispositions. You can configure different types (Redial, Add to DNC, and so on) for many system dispositions. Other options, such as timers, can be enabled for all system dispositions.

System Disposition Descriptions

The table below lists all the default system dispositions along with a description.

Note: You can create a custom disposition along with a description. See Adding Custom Dispositions.

Name Description No Disposition Default disposition selected by agents when no dispositions are defined for a campaign.

System Error System failure, such as lost database connection.

Dial Error Carrier failed to dial a number. A specific form of a system error.

Busy Busy signal when number was dialed.

Name Description IVR. Do Not Call disposition may also be assigned by agent request. SIP response codes for DIAL_BLOCKED and DO_NOT_CONTACT are mapped to this System disposition.

Recycle Agent requested to redial this number.

Agent Error Agent session terminated before a call is completed, which occurs when the agent’s connection to the VCC is severed during a call.

Domain host shut down during a call.

System Shutdown

Caller Disconnected

Caller hung up while inside the IVR but not in an ACD queue (see abandon). Seen when caller disconnects during the IVR process or when listening to a prompt. Default disposition for many IVR modules.

Unknown Connection

System disposition used when a digital phone line is identified during call progress detection.

No Response From Caller

Caller did not provide a response to a prompt, such as entering digits. The disposition can be assigned to a module in an IVR script.

Caller was directed to Five9 VCC voicemail.

Sent To Voicemail

Operator Intercept

Called party was preempted by a telecom operator or other operator service due to invalid, unknown, or unidentified number or other operator blocking services.

Queue callback request created and delivered to an agent in place of the call.

Queue Callback Assigned

Queue callback request created in place of the call, but no agents were available during the specified time.

Name Description Hangup On telecom level we send DialEvent CONNECT_HANGUP when outbound call is disconnected before ISDN connect or after it if channel performs Answering Machine Detection on this call. It is not similar to OPERATOR_INTERCEPT: no reason to repeat call to this number. Repeating call after CONNECT_HANGUP could be successful. Five9 dials a number. If the call is disconnected by the dialed party or the party's carrier, the Five9 dialing timeout was not yet expired when the disconnect occurred unlike a NO_ANSWER disposition. On further processing higher level (Campaign) DialEvent CONNECT_HANGUP cause HANGUP disposition to be set.

Voicemail Processed

Voicemail completely processed by agent. No further action required.

Voicemail Dump

System disposition used to indicate when a voicemail recording must be discarded by the system. Bad voicemail that should be deleted.

Forward Participant

Used for the forwarding leg of the call when a call is forwarded to an agent’s alternate phone number when using call forwarding and the agent is not logged in. A call to the campaign is forwarded to a specific agent (not to skill), this agent is not logged in and VCC forwards this call to the external number. So the VCC sets this disposition for the second call (from VCC to agent’s call forward phone).

Forwarded Used for the initial leg of calls that are forwarded to agents’ alternate phone numbers when using call forwarding. Disposition for the first call (from customer to VCC).

Internal Call Special disposition for internal calls (internal calls do not belong to any campaign).

Force Stop Call is disconnected because a campaign is force stopped by an administrator or supervisor.

Resource Unavailable

Inbound call arrives in the system, but it is not handled because no virtual inbound lines are available. Applies to inbound campaigns only. No campaign lines or domain lines were available when the call was received. Call was rejected.

Ensuring that Dropped Call Percentages Comply with FCC Regulations

FCC regulations require that the percentage of dropped calls from all outbound campaigns fall within specified guidelines. The maximum percentage allowed for the call abandonment is currently 3% for each campaign every 30 days. However, you should refer to the FCC regulations for requirements and call abandonment rate calculation to ensure that you have the up-to-date information.

Five9 modified the calculation for the dropped call percentage to ensure that custom dispositions are not included in this calculation.

Note: The abandon rate 2-second rule calculation option allows you to use a queue time of 2 seconds or higher to identify outbound calls as abandoned.

307 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 310

Dispositions

Adding Custom Dispositions

The Outbound Campaign Abandon Rate % 2 Seconds Rule standard report shows these values.

Agents can use the No Party Contact disposition when connected to a non-live entity (for example, an answering or fax machine). Because the FCC calculation for abandoned calls excludes calls connected to non-live parties, using the No Party Contact disposition for reasons other than not connecting to live parties increases the dropped call percentage and Dialer Drop Call % rates (abandoned call rates).

Creating Custom Dispositions

You can create a custom disposition for calls passed to an agent when no person is reached, such as when calls reach an answering machine. In these cases, agents should use the appropriate custom disposition to indicate that they did not reach a person.

1 In the Dispositions folder in the navigation pane, right-click Custom Dispositions

and select Add Disposition.

l Description - statement or purpose that identifies the disposition.

l Agent Must Confirm - requires that agents confirm the choice of disposition.

l Agent Must Complete Worksheet - for campaigns that contain worksheets,

requires that agents complete a worksheet before this disposition can be selected.

l Worksheet Cannot Be Used With This Disposition - for campaigns that contain

worksheets, ensures that agents cannot use this disposition if they have completed a worksheet for the current call. This option works as a safeguard against accidentally setting incorrect dispositions when a completed worksheet indicates that a different disposition should be set.

l Send Email Notification - sends an email every time this disposition is selected.

The email can contain details about the call, such as agent name, time, date, contact details, comments, and worksheet data (see Defining Email Notifications). The email can be sent to a fixed email address or an email address specified in a contact record.

Note

Email notification for dispositions is not currently supported for text interactions.

l Send IM Notification - Similar to email notification except that call details are

sent as an instant message. Use this option if call details must be immediately received by one or more users in your VCC.

l Track as First Call Resolution - primarily for inbound campaigns, includes the call

in your first call resolution statistics for supervisors or reports: the customer’s needs were addressed in the first call.

l Reset Attempts Counter - dispositions reset the dial attempts counter back to

zero. Use for agent-selected redial dispositions when a contact has requested a callback after several failed attempts to reach the number (making the contact record at risk for reaching the dial attempts limit and not being dialed again).

l Allowed Only for 3rd-Party Transfer and Conferences - agents can use this

disposition only for third-party transfers and conferences. If this option is enabled, you may optionally type a specific number to which calls are transferred or conferenced before assigning the disposition.

l No Party Contact - Agent indicates that no contact occurred with a person

during the call. Because custom dispositions for No Party Contact or Abandoned Calls can affect FCC compliance, they are excluded from the abandoned call percentage calculation.

You must acknowledge that such dispositions are not included in the calculation of the abandoned call percentage: after you check the box, a pop-up window asks you to acknowledge that this disposition is not used in abandoned call percentage calculation. When a custom disposition is used, the check box appears. You select the custom disposition from the disposition list and acknowledge that the disposition is excluded from the abandoned call percentage calculation.

The options are similar to those available in the Dialing Options tab of outbound campaign properties for answering machine detection:

l Do Not Leave Message - default option.

l Play Prompt - agents who are connected to an answering machine or

voicemailbox can disconnect from a call and leave a message for an answering machine. The prompt is played either after a two-second silence is detected (for example, after the tone, please leave a message... beep) or after the configured Max Answering Machine Greeting Time. One prompt can be configured per disposition.

l Play IVR Script (Advanced) - agents who are connected to an answering machine

or voicemailbox can disconnect from a call but leave a message playing for an answering machine. The IVR script is played either after a two-second silence is detected (for example, after the tone, please leave a message... beep) or after the configured Max Answering Machine Greeting Time.

The default Max Answering Machine Greeting Time is 20 seconds. If an outbound campaign that uses these Answering Machine prompt/IVR dispositions dials many cell phone numbers, Five9 recommends to raise this setting higher - for example, to 40 seconds - due to the usually longer voicemail greeting messages.

You can use of branching logic or dynamic Text-to-Speech when leaving a message. For example, to configure an IVR script that plays a personalized message from the agent assigned to the call, you can configure a Case module, with the Agent.user_name variable and connect the branches to one Play module for each agent. Another example would be to leave a message with dynamic Text-to-Speech, which can play information such as an account balance to a client.

These options currently work only with automated dialing by outbound campaigns - such as, Power, Predictive, or Progressive dialing modes. Preview dialing, manual calls, and inbound calls are not supported, and the prompt or IVR script is not played.

You create campaign profiles for inbound, outbound, and autodial campaigns to define the behavior of campaign components and define the campaign characteristics. Campaign profiles enable you to override campaign defaults such as the default ANI.

You can assign a profile to a campaign when you start the campaign in Advanced mode. The campaign uses the properties you define in the profile. You can create as many profiles as you need, but you can only associate one Profile per campaign. A profile can be used simultaneously by more than one campaign. You can automatically change the profile for the campaign by using workflow rules.

With campaign profiles, you can filter and sort lists, control pop-up windows in the agent interface, and manage disposition counts. You can create, edit, and delete profiles.

Campaign Profiles

l Name and Description: Name and optional description of the profile.

l Initial Call Priority (inbound or outbound): Inbound calls have a default priority of

60 on a scale of 1 to 100. Calls with a higher priority (100) are answered first, regardless of their time in a queue. If a campaign uses a profile with a higher priority, calls belonging to that campaign are answered first. For calls from a campaign to be answered before calls from other campaigns, increase the priority by one.

l Max Queue Time (Outbound): Maximum time that the dialed party is held by the

dialer if no agents are available to process the call. After the maximum queue time expires, the action selected as the Action on Max Queue Time Expiration under the Dialing Options tab is taken. The default value is one second. Counting from the end of the called party’s greeting, the maximum value allowed by the FCC for dialed calls is two seconds before the call is considered dropped. The remaining second is used by call analysis, if enabled, and for routing the call across the network.

Important

Do not increase the default value, except in specific cases, such as when using a dialer to connect calls to remote employees.

l Max Charges (Inbound or Outbound): Dollar amount for Maximum Long

Distance Charges. The campaign stops automatically when this amount of long distance charges is reached. A setting of zero means no limit.

l Dialing Timeout (Outbound): Enables the administrator to configure how long

the system waits before an unanswered call is disconnected and logged as No Answer. In other words, this is how long the dialer rings a number. Sometimes this time period is equated to number of rings but it is actually measured in seconds. The default is 20 seconds.

Dialing timeout allows the administrator to increase the ring time (not the number of rings) in an effort to reach more answering machines or give the called party more time to pick up the phone. For autodial campaigns it is sometimes beneficial to increase the dialing timeout in an attempt to capture more answering machines.

Warning

This setting has a direct effect on how answering machines and no answers are reported. If the timeout is increased, expect to receive more answering machines and fewer no answer dispositions. More importantly, if your list is producing a lot of unanswered calls, increasing this setting means it takes longer to process the list and potentially increase the agent idle time.

Telemarketing regulations in the U.S. require that calls ring for a minimum of 15 seconds. If you are running telemarketing campaigns, do not reduce this setting to less than 15 seconds.

l Number of Attempts (outbound, autodial): This is an outbound dialer setting.

The counter for the Number of Attempts counts all dial attempts for phone numbers in a list record, including redials due to disposition settings.

The campaign profile option overrides disposition counters, rather than working with them, in cases where the Profile option is set lower than a disposition option. See also: Disposition Settings/Options (Type tab > Redial Number > Number of attempt.)

The profile and disposition counters restrict dialing to individual numbers within a record, rather than to the entire record.

For campaign profiles with very low values for the Number of Attempts setting, Five9 recommends increasing the values.

Campaigns running in Basic Mode (without an assigned Profile) use a default of five attempts.

l Dialing Schedule:

o Include Number: Using the check boxes, you can define which contact

number the dialer should consider.

o Start At (outbound): Sets the dialing hours for an outbound campaign. The

default dialing hours are 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM based on the time zone of the phone number being dialed, not your local time zone. To change the default starting time when the dialer begins dialing numbers based on local time for an outbound campaign, change the Start At setting. The time when the dialer dials to the states can be also defined by State Dialing Rules.

o Stop After (outbound): To change the default stopping time (when the

dialer stops dialing numbers based on their local time) for an Outbound Campaign, change the Stop After setting. When changing this setting, keep in mind that the time is based on the time zone of the phone number being dialed. The time when the dialer dials to the states can be also defined by State Dialing Rules.

o Dialing Order: This field specifies the dialing order for multiple phone

numbers on contact records. If your lists contain multiple phone numbers for contact records, you can change the order in which the numbers are dialed.

l Dial ASAP List Record Queue for Web APIs: The options allow you to specify the

sort order and timeout for the newly added ASAP records (Web2Campaign or APIs). For more information, see Five9 Web2Campaign Developer's and Administrator's guide: Five9Administrator Setup.

o Timeout: The default value is one hour. The time-sensitive ASAP list

records are removed from the ASAP queue after the timeout period. Following the time-out period, any leads not dialed are treated normal records in the list.

o Sort Order: The dialer follows the selected list order for the new ASAP

records.

– FIFO (first in, first out) – LIFO (last in, first out): Select this order if your last lead has the best chance of closing business. – Contact Record Field(s): Select this order if you want the campaign profile’s sort order to be used. For example, sorting by contact first name applies a different sort order than using LIFO or FIFO sort order.

o Number of dial attempts for ASAP record: The default value is zero (0).

This option indicates the number of dial attempts for the time-sensitive ASAP record, after which it loses the ASAP flag (priority) and becomes a normal (priority) record.

The default value of zero (0) indicates that the dial attempt number of the time-sensitive ASAP record should not be tracked. Only the timeout option value dictates when the ASAP records lose the ASAP flag (priority) and become normal (priority) records.

If the value assigned to the ASAP records is any other positive integer, the records lose their priority flag and become normal priority records after reaching the assigned number of dial attempts.

Note

Campaign profile rules may affect the number of records available to dial that is displayed in the Supervisor application. Because these dialing rules may apply to future calls, they may not match reports reflecting numbers immediately available to be dialed.

To override the default ANI for a campaign, enter the number here. If you use a Profile for other purposes, you must still enter an ANI. If you do not want to change the default ANI, enter your default ANI in this field. The Default Outbound ANI would be used when a campaign dials a number without a prefix/area code that has an assigned ANI within the ANI Group. You can configure ANIs starting with a + sign. The maximum number length for international numbers is 17 digits, plus prefix. The prefix may be 011 (for a total of 20 digits) or + (for a total of 17 digits and a + sign).

Disposition count allows you to automatically stop an Inbound or Outbound Campaign after the specified disposition has been selected a specified number of times. For example, if you have 100 items to sell, use Disposition Count to automatically stop dialing after the Sales disposition has been selected 100 times. To do this, set a Disposition Count equal to your product inventory.

This feature can be used for things such as controlling inventory, mailing applications or fliers of which you have a limited amount printed, limiting appointments based on staffing, and so on. The Disposition count is an event.

Types of Prompts Managing Voice Prompts

The Prompts folder in the Five9 Administrator is used to upload sound files to use in IVR prompts, custom hold music, and skill group audio files. Audio files are used also for voicemail greetings, but they are uploaded directly to the User or Skill Group properties window.

A voice prompt is an audio file used in IVR scripts to play a greeting or give callers instructions or information, for example: Thank you for calling Acme Company. Please hold for the next available agent or Please press 1 for Technical Support or 2 for Sales.

Audio files require this format: WAVE audio, ITU G.711 mu-law, mono 8000 Hz. In some applications, the format may be listed as CCITT u-Law, 8.000 kHz, 8 bit, Mono, 7 kb/sec.

Create a prompt by using one of these methods:

l Use a professional voice-over service. Five9 recommends this option for a caller

friendly experience in your IVR.

l Record your own by using recording software such as Microsoft Sound Recorder.

l Use the built-in Text-to-Speech engine. Import audio files into the Prompts folder in the Administrator’s desktop. An imported prompt can be used in multiple inbound campaigns. Prompts can be played sequentially by linking multiple Play modules in the IVR. Prompts can be edited.

Types of Prompts

If you need to select a prompt, you can choose from default prompts, uploaded prompts (voice audio files), and TTS prompts.

Default Prompts

Five9 provide a few default prompts but, for best results, recommends that you record and import custom prompts. The default prompts are displayed in the same list as any of your imported prompts in the Play module.

Several prompts can be saved sequentially to achieve the message that you need, for example: Extension two three four five is not available, and Please leave a message after the tone. This table contains the default prompts:

In the IVR properties, you can select the prompts that will be played to callers while the module is executed. The list of prompts includes the default prompts and the prompts you added to the Prompts folder. You may also use Text-to-Speech (TTS) for dynamic

Types of Prompts

prompts. However, Five9 recommends that you limit the use of TTS to short phrases, such as call variable values or contact field values. For example, you may want to provide the caller’s checking account balance by using TTS to say the current balance.

You can also make the selected prompts interruptible: the prompt stops as soon as the background operation is completed.

Text to Speech

Text to Speech (TTS) functionality allows you to create a voice prompt from text using different voice characters available from the library. TTS is the only way to provide your customers with dynamic voice messaging being used in the IVR scripts. For example, you can provide the inbound customers with information about their account balance using the IVR script which asks the customer to enter their account number. The script queries the database to get the current balance and finally generates the voice message with the customer’s balance amount which is played to the customer.

Five9 does not recommend that you use this functionality as the main way to create voice messages for your customers. Messages generated by TTS have a computer- sounding voice, which is not suitable for extended messages. Five9 recommends that you record real voice messages and combine the messages using the TTS only to say the values of variables. For example, record the phrase Your balance is in a sound recorder and upload it to the system. During the creation of the prompt, combine this message with a TTS message that plays the balance amount.

The TTS Script Builder is designed to prepare the rendered text for the TTS engine. The text may consist of predefined pieces of text and the content of variables.

The Builder can be used in Advanced Mode or in Simplified Mode (Default). The only difference is allowing the SSML text to render with explicit use of the SSML tags. The Advanced Mode check box is used to switch between modes.

Modes Simplified Mode. The TTS Script Builder dialog consists of the three main panels:

l Bottom Panel: Shows the complete text cleared from any structuring insertions

(XML tags). This is a read-only text box intended for easy control and navigation purposes. Click a word in the panel selects the left panel’s string, which contains

If the TTS Builder is activated from the Add Prompt dialog in the Prompts folder, only substrings and pauses are available:

l Text Element

l Break Element These elements can be added by using the Add button.

Advanced Mode. Checking the Advanced Mode box enables the TTS advanced mode. With this setting it is possible to improve the sound quality of the prompts by rendering the text with the SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags. In this mode, the left panel contains the SSML tags along with text, variable, and break elements. The tags should be visually distinguished from the term elements (in the figure the last ones are displayed in Bold).

The tags appear in pairs (opening tag has the symbol > attached to the end of its name, closing tag is marked by leading <). Click a string with the opening or closing tag to select whole strings between them (shown red in the figure), so selecting the tag means selecting all enclosed elements.

An additional column with check boxes serves to select elements that need to be included inside a new tag pair. The customer can switch on several subsequent elements (for example Dear, $Salutation, $first_name, $last_name) and press the Add button. After selecting the Add sentence command from the menu, the newly created pair s>/<s appears around the selected terms (see the figure). Use the <CTRL> or <SHIFT> keys to select more than one term. The Advanced mode allows you to add these elements:

The Break element is an empty element that controls the pausing or other stress and intonation patterns between words. The use of the Break element between any pair of words is optional. If the element is not present between words, the synthesis processor is expected to automatically determine a break based on the linguistic context.

The alternative attributes in this element are Strength and Time. The corresponding panel contains the options for the attributes selection, the Strength menu, and the Time entry field. The last two controls are enabled with the corresponding selections.

The Strength menu has the following possible values. Duration in ms of the pause.

letters N/A Pronounce alphanumerical strings as a sequence of individual letters and digits. With detail strict punctuation is also spoken (such as, speaking a comma as comma). Letters with detail strict is equivalent to acronym with detail strict. For true spelling of all readable characters, use the interpret- as value spell.

STRING

measure N/A Variety of units (for example, km, hr, dB, lb, MHz) is supported; the units may appear immediately next to a number (for example, 1cm) or be separated by a space (for example, 15 ms). For some units, the singular and plural distinction may not always be made correctly.

Connectors

Understanding Connectors Creating a ClassicConnector Managing Connectors

Connectors are URLs used to automate tasks such as looking up a customer record or completing a form. Connectors help agents find information or trigger an action in campaigns in which connectors are defined. You can search for call variables that contain customer data as well as call parameters, such as call length, handle time, wrap-up time, skill transfer, queue time, and hold time. Actions performed by connectors are typically to GET or POST information about a contact record. Connectors may also execute form submission or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Important

If you plan to use parameters that contain sensitive data in your connectors, use secure URLs and the POST method. You cannot save a connector that contains sensitive data with a non-secure URL or with the GET method.

You can use connectors for a variety of purposes, such as these:

l Open an ordering system.

l Integrate with third-party tools or systems to send and reuse information, such

as analytics.

l Post data to a web page or web form.

l Look up a contact record in a local or web application.

l Send information to or request information from an external database by using a

web service. Connectors, in most cases, are executed in the agent’s computer and your domain can support up to 1000 queued requests. Up to 10 requests can be processed simultaneously. Agents do not require permission to use connectors. However, to use an embedded Web browser to open a URL, you must give permission to agents. For more information, see Agent Permissions.

Each call record contains data fields about who handled the call, the campaign in which it is used, the contact, and the disposition of the call. This information can be

Understanding Connectors

substituted in the connector URL and executed when the agent is processing a call. See System Call Variables Groups for a list of all available parameters.

Understanding Connectors

Connectors comprise a URL, a script that defines the action taken by the connector (a GET or POST command), some delimiters, and one or more parameters that define the data to retrieve from the URL or post to the target URL, such as a database or third- party tool. The URL, script, and keywords come from your application, form, or tool, not from Five9 applications.

URL Strings URL Parameters Names of Parameters Worksheet Fields Connector Execution in the Agent’s System Connector Examples

URL Strings

The URL defines the host name, the script to execute, the parameters passed to this script, and the keywords that map to the VCC data.

Five9 Virtual Contact Center (VCC) supports standard HTTP and secure HTTPS protocols. HTTPS can be used for the system disposition connectors. For secure connections, you may use certificates in cases where the external Web server uses a root certificate (unsigned/self-signed public key certificate). You can import CRT files or enable Accept All Certificates. Configure certificates in Actions > Configure > Certificates. See Installing a Certificate.

Use this syntax:

http://www.domain.com/page.htm?keyWord_1=@parameter_1@&keyWord_2=@par- rameter_2@

domain.com Domain where the URL exists. The URL standard contains a port specification, for example: www.domain.com means http://www.domain.com:80. The default port is generally omitted. Five9 URLs do not use a port other than 80.

? Indicates that a sequence of keywords and parameters follows. The question mark is added automatically to the URL.

@ Must precede and end each parameter definition.

& Indicates another keyword-parameter combination follows.

Define the data to GET or POST.

keyWord =@parameter@

URL Parameters

A connector parameter is a field or constant that is appended to the URL. URL strings are generated automatically when parameters are formatted properly.

l Parameter names are case sensitive.

l The string must be in URL format.

l Connectors usually include one or more VCC parameters and their associated

keywords.

l Connectors often display a static Web page, knowledge base, or list.

Types of Parameters The type of call data handled by the parameter is identified by its name.

Agent Data Parameters

Identifies the agent who handled the call in which the connector was executed. Format: Agent.parameter Example: Agent. username, Agent.id

Call Data Parameters

Information about the call record that is passed in the connector. Format: Call.parameter Example: Call.session_id, Call.disposition_id, Call.campaign_id

Customer Data Parameters

The CRM fields available in your domain, including the Five9 default fields and your custom fields. Format: Customer.parameter Example: Customer.number, Customer.company For example, if you create a CRM field called, email_address, the parameter would be listed as Customer.email_address.

To display a list of all possible parameters, navigate to Connector > General Properties.

Connectors

Understanding Connectors

Using International Phone Numbers in Connectors If your domain is not enabled for the format for international phone numbers, your agents must enter 10 digits to conform to the North American Numbering Plan. If your domain is enabled for the format, your agents need to enter phone numbers for all calls according to your configuration: in your national format or up to 15 digits, starting with the plus (+) sign and the country code. If set accordingly in your VCC configuration, connectors may display the customers’ phone numbers in the same localized format in pop-up windows.

GET and POST Methods in Connectors For GET methods, the URL length is limited to 2048 characters after the Five9 contact parameters are populated. This is the length of the URL when executed on the agent's computer with all contact data populated. In some cases, depending on the contact fields you choose to use (such as first name); the URL length varies because a standard field length may not exist.

When executing POST connectors, a security setting in the browser must be enabled. See also Connector Execution in the Agent’s System.

Configure connector parameters in the Connector Properties window.

Parameters that Contain Sensitive Data in Connectors To use parameters that contain sensitive data in your connectors, use secure URLs and the POST method. You cannot save a connector that contains sensitive data with a non- secure URL or with the GET method.

Connectors Executed in Browsers You can execute a connector in a new browser window or embedded in the browser.

Important

Because of their security policies, browsers do not accept mixed content unless they are configured to do so. For example, if you combine secure and non- secure URLs, such as in an integration, the connector may not open in the browser. This issue occurs with Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer.

To prevent issues, when you create a connector, always use secure URLs and/or enable Execute in Browser. You must use HTTPS to embed connectors for Web agents. Otherwise these connectors are not displayed.

389 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

Connectors

Understanding Connectors

Note

Connectors that are triggered by a disposition are executed in a new browser window when the disposition completes the interaction (call).

Some web sites, such as google.com, use the x-frame-options:SAMEORIGIN header to prevent the web site from being embedded into an iframe in another site. If you plan to use the Embedded tab in the Agent Desktop Plus application, locate the special embedded URL to use in a connector in that web site.

Names of Parameters

The Five9 VCC provides a set of standard parameter names for connectors. Connector parameters in the connector URL must begin and end with an at sign (@), such as in @Customer.first_name@.

Separate additional keyword-parameter pairs with an ampersand (&). The type of call data handled by the parameter is identified by its name. Parameter names are case sensitive.

The customer data parameters are the contact fields available in your VCC, including the Five9 default fields and custom fields you create. For example, if you create a contact field called email_address, the parameter would be Customer.email_address.

l Use the POST method to populate worksheet data in a Connector URL.

l Worksheet questions are automatically inserted into the URL string when the

connector is executed on the agent workstation.

l Worksheet question names are the parameters and the answers are the values.

Therefore, your worksheet question names must match the parameters used in the script called by the connector.

Connector Execution in the Agent’s System

Most connectors are executed automatically. The trigger setting for the connector determines when it is activated such as when a call is accepted, a disposition is set, or upon a transfer. See Selecting the Trigger for a description of possible triggers. After the first execution, the connector is stored in memory on the agent’s system. If you change a connector, agents must log out and log in again to reload the new connector settings.

When executing POST connectors with Internet Explorer, you must enable a security setting.

1 In Internet Explorer, select Tools > Internet Options.

2 Select the Advanced tab.

Managing Connectors

Example

Account ID in a chat request: When a customer submits a chat request with an account ID, that account ID can be passed in a connector to a customer’s third-party system to present the customer’s account information to the agent.

1 Create a custom chat console field called account_id. 2 Create a call variable group. Assign to this call variable group an intuitive

name, such as ChatVariables. See Creating Call Variable Groups for more information. 3 Create a call variable to store the new custom chat field. Name this

variable account_id and assign the variable type String. See Creating Call Variables for more information.

Example

Route interactions based on text channel profiles. You can use the Call.campaign_name, which contains the name of the profile to dynamically route text interactions based on subcategories, such as Sales chat inquiry and Support chat request.

Example

Route interactions based on customer sentiment. If your domain is enabled for Natural Language Processing (NLP), you can route interactions to NLP:

1 Create a variable named Omni.Subject, type=string, to map to the title of

an email request 2 Create a new variable named Omni.Content, type= string, that maps to

the email body or chat text content. 3 You can send this information to the NLP real time engine to determine

customer sentiment before routing to specialists or teams that handle happy customer comments or angry customer comments.

Understanding Workflow Rules Creating Workflow Rules Deleting Workflow Rules

This feature enables you to automate campaign-related tasks. Workflow rules are conditional statements defined by events and the actions that take place when the events are triggered. Rules are used mostly in outbound campaigns. For example, you can create a rule to start another campaign when an outbound campaign stops because it is out of numbers.

The information displayed in the columns can be accessed and updated in the Workflow Rule Properties window. You can add, update, enable, disable, and delete workflow rules. All system-wide actions are available through the View Event Log menu. See Event Log of Workflow Rule Actions and Activities.

An event is a condition that must be true for the action to take place. You can define a workflow rule to contain one or several events. You can add multiple events and join them with operators to form logical expressions. When the conditions defined by the expression are true, the event is triggered.

Specifying Time Zones in Date and Time Events You can use Time Zone as an event parameter. The time zones are displayed using Time Zone Abbreviations (such as, MST, MDT, PST), or the format established in the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) time Zone Database (such as, America/Phoenix, America/Los Angeles).

The Time Zone list items in Virtual Contact Center (VCC) Administrator’s Application are provided by the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) dictionary. In addition to the time offset (such as, GMT-08:00) each entry includes a zone caption to indicate its purpose. Some of the time zone definitions are obsolete, but are kept by JRE for (non-Five9) backward compatibility.

How to Choose a Time Zone for Time Events Some time zone options appear to be redundant, such as those for Pacific time. Here are examples of Pacific time zone that appear in the Time Zone list:

Each of the options could differ, indicating a history of changes such as dates for switching to daylight savings time and back.

In this case, the safest selection would be America/Los Angeles, PST; it covers both Pacific Standard Time (PST) and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), and is based on the current IANA database definition. The PST8PDT, PST option will also work for the same purpose. the US/Pacific, PST and US/Pacific-New, PST options are obsolete and should be avoided.

If an action cannot be executed (attempting to start a campaign that does not have a list for example), the action is skipped and the next action in the list is attempted.

Errors and exceptions can cause a rule to be automatically disabled. These exceptions are recorded in the event log. for example:

l Recursion - Execution of an action causes triggering the action again. In this case,

the rule is automatically disabled.

Call Variables

Creating Call Variable Groups Creating Call Variables Adding Call Variables to Campaign Profiles Linking Call Variables to Dispositions Transferring User-to-User Information with Call Variables System Call Variables Groups

Call variables are custom fields that store call data instead of contact records. During a call, they can be used and updated in the IVR and by agents. When configuring dispositions, you can also set the value for call variables that should be stored for reporting purposes when that disposition is used, or when any disposition is used. With call variables, you can gather more information about each call. For example, you can collect error codes generated by IVR and find out how many times a speech input was provided, an account balance retrieved, and customer satisfaction survey results.

In addition to U.S currency, all currency variables support the British Pound and Euro currencies.

You can use call variables in connectors and IVR scripts to send information, for example, to third-party systems. Optionally, call variables can be stored to use in reports. The variables are organized in groups, similar to classes used in many programming languages. When using a variable, follow this syntax:

[Call Variable Group Name].[Call Variable Name]

Example

Call.mediatype

In reports, you can summarize call variable values across calls to provide the total sale amount per agent or per campaign based on individual sale amounts from each call.

In the Call Variables folder, you can create items variables in predefined variable groups or add custom groups. For example, you can create skill-based groups or groups for surveys, sales, error handling to store more information about error codes generated by IVR, and speech recognition events.

Transferring User-to-User Information with Call Variables

You can use call variables to transfer User-to-User Information (UUI) data between the VCC and other telephony systems, such as other call centers or PBX systems, by using the SIP protocol. UUI data is information not pertaining to the call, such as an account number. The call variables values are transferred without modification.

This table and the figure that follows describe outbound and inbound calls with a UUI example.

Call Variables

Transferring User-to-User Information with Call Variables

The call is transferred from the caller to the agent. The UUI data is received by the Five9 VCC in incoming SIP calls.

Outbound Calls Inbound Calls The call is transferred from the agent to the external application that supports UUI. The UUI data is sent from the Five9 VCC to a third-party call center or PBX system in outgoing SIP calls.

A customer calls an 800 number assigned to the Five9 VCC. In the VCC IVR menus, the customer enters information, such as account number and personal identity, that corresponds to call variables. The information captured by the IVR is attached to the call in UUI or other SIP headers. The VCC IVR transfers the call to a third- party call center or PBX system, which extracts the data to route the call to the appropriate skill group or agent. Once the agent accepts the call, all data originally entered by the caller is transferred to the agent. The agent does not have to enter that information again.

Requirements

Before using this feature, you must be able to provision a private SIP trunk to connect to Five9 across the internet, VPN, or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). With VPN and MPLS, you may incur additional fees. For more information about private SIP trunks and to implement this feature, contact your Five9 representative or Professional Services.

Creating Call Variables

You need to create these items:

443 Basic Configuration • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 446

Call Variables

Transferring User-to-User Information with Call Variables

l A call variable group specific to UUI data. You may choose any group name.

l As many variables as you need for the data that you want to transfer between

locations. You may choose any variable names. Variables can have any format, value, restrictions, and default values. Choose the format expected by the remote side to which the SIP trunk is linked. For example, if you expect UUI data to be an integer, create an integer variable.

Example

Your remote call center or PSTN system expects UUI data in the body of a User- To-User SIP header to be an integer. Your call variable for UUI data is named my.var. Its type is integer. The IVR script validates the format of the value when assigning it to the variable. Five9 inserts the value of my.var in the initial SIP message of each outbound call as follows: User-To-User=<my.var-value>.

Preparing Your Implementation

When done, provide to Five9 the names and types of your variables, such as string or date, for the UUI data to add to SIP headers.

While Five9 is setting up your implementation, add the call variables to campaigns and IVR scripts as usual. You can start transferring data as soon as Five9 has completed your implementation.

Types of Campaigns

Outbound Campaigns Inbound Campaigns Autodial Campaigns

Outbound Campaigns

Outbound campaigns are used to dial customers in lists that you create and to deliver the calls to the agents that process the calls. The dialing process is typically handled by the dialer. Outbound campaigns may use one of four dialing modes: the predictive, power, or progressive dialer modes to dial through a list of contacts and deliver connected calls to your agents. An additional preview dialing mode allows agents to preview contacts and individually dial their numbers. For more information, see Configuring Dialing Modes, Options, and Call Processing in Outbound Campaigns.

When managing outbound campaigns, you must understand how the dialer works and how lists are processed. For more information, see Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns.

Inbound Campaigns

Inbound campaigns are used to receive customer calls coming from a DNIS. The calls are processed according to your rules in the IVR script of the campaign. With the inbound campaign, you can use customized greetings and create different scenarios for

Types of Campaigns

Interactive Voice Response (IVR). Automated call routing of customer inquiries is used to transfer calls to the most appropriate agents:

l Incoming calls can be sent to agents based on availability or skill with custom

prompts and hold music.

l You can create loops and branching. You can collect caller information.

l You can use contact data.

l If queue times are long or agents are unavailable, callers can leave a message.

l Calls can be forwarded to a third party when agents are not available.

l You can prioritize inbound call traffic. etc. To create IVR scripts that automate skills-based call routing, see Routing Users to Skill Groups in the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Administrator's Guide.

The campaign must be running to answer inbound calls. Otherwise, callers hear a busy signal.

Autodial Campaigns

Autodial campaigns are designed to dial phone numbers in a list and to use call- progress detection to understand whether the call was received by an answering machine or person. When a call is answered, it follows a predefined IVR Script. The most common flows include leaving messages to the called party. You can also optionally configure the auto-dialer so that your customers can interact with a menu of options and messages, and even allow them to add their phone number to the do-not- call list without interacting with an agent. So, with Five9’s advanced capabilities you can define many different flows to meet your business needs. And each successfully connected number will follow the call flow defined for the campaign. The call flow can even pass an outbound call to an agent.

When one of your customers needs to talk to a live agent, the call can be queued up for the next available agent. When your agents are connected to live parties, they can follow the scripts you've written and record the results in the Five9 contact history.

Autodial Campaigns can dial multiple numbers at the same time based on the number of lines available for your account and the number of lines allocated to the campaign. There is an ability to stop dialing based on agent availability.

If your call flow does not have the possibility to deliver calls to agents, you need to consider only running it at the times when you want to deliver your messages to your customer base. You can either manually start and stop campaigns or use a profile to help you in delivering your messages at targeted times.

Autodial Information in Reports Telemarketing Rules Types of Autodial Campaigns Campaign Profiles for Autodial Campaigns Dispositions for Autodial Campaigns Testing Autodial Campaigns

Autodial Information in Reports To determine if a contact hangs up before listening to the entire message, check the total length of the call in reports. If the call is shorter than the length of your message, you know the contact hung up before the message completed. You could also verify the path in the IVR flow that the customer took by creating a report and looking at the ivr_flow column.

To view the IVR path taken for each autodial call, look at reports, which may contain an ivr_flow column. This column shows the IVR modules used by the call. Because the ivr_flow field uses the module name, Five9 recommends to identify each step of the call flow by naming each module accordingly.

You are responsible to know and comply with the telemarketing regulations in the regions in which you operate. Consult your compliance team if you are not sure about applicable laws.

In the U.S., autodial campaigns are governed by the Federal Trade Commission’s telemarketing sales rule. You may not use an autodialer for telemarketing purposes. You may use an autodialer only if you have an existing business relationship with the people you are calling. For example, they may be used for collections, feature announcements, reminders to existing customers, or for exempt organizations, such as charities or political campaigns. For more details, a copy of the telemarketing sales rule can be found online at the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule Web site.

Types of Autodial Campaigns Autodial campaigns comprise these categories:

l Basic Autodial Campaign: Plays a message to answering machines. The message

in the Play modules can be the same or different.

Types of Campaigns

l Smart Autodial Survey: Plays a prompt to the connected party and records the

response in a contact field. If an answering machine is detected, the system disconnects the call. See Configuring Autodial Agent Linkback Campaigns.

l Automated message delivery campaigns: Plays a recorded message to persons

and answering machines, for example to broadcast a recorded message.

l Agent Linkback - Usually plays a recorded message to answering machines but

gives persons the option to connect to an agent.

l Autodial Campaign to Record a Response in Voice mail: The Voicemail Transfer

module plays a greeting providing instructions to the contact and asks to record the response.

Campaign Profiles for Autodial Campaigns All campaign profile features can be used with autodial campaigns. For example, you can use a campaign profile to start and stop dialing automatically, based on the time of day. Use the Start At and Stop After settings to set the start and stop times. You can adjust more settings by using profiles.

In the example below, the campaign dials between 8AM and 9PM to phone numbers in the number1 contact field of list records. Remember to account for time zones, as the dialing hours are based on the time zone of the phone number being dialed, not your local time zone.

See Outbound Campaign General Properties.

Types of Campaigns

Dispositions for Autodial Campaigns Because many autodial calls do not reach an agent, to be assigned a disposition, autodial campaigns can record a disposition in some IVR modules. The purpose of IVR dispositions is to provide reporting of where the call disconnected in the IVR flow. For example, your autodial campaign plays a message when a person answers and disconnects the call with the Hang Up module. The disposition in the Hang Up module is recorded as the result of the call. In this case, the disposition for the Hang Up module can be message left - person.

Autodial campaigns have two disposition categories:

l Agent dispositions are used when a call is connected to a Five9 agent.

l IVR dispositions are used by the system when a call is disconnected during the

IVR flow. To determine which IVR dispositions are required, create an IVR flow first, and add the dispositions as needed. You can also use the default dispositions assigned by the system. All IVR dispositions have the same configuration options as agent dispositions. Features such as Send Email Notification and Add to DNC are available.

Agent Must Confirm, Agent Must Complete Worksheet, and Worksheet Cannot Be Used With This Disposition are configuration options that apply only if the call reaches the agent. They do not apply to IVR Dispositions.

Testing Autodial Campaigns Before running an autodial campaign, Five9 recommends that you test the campaign.

1 Upload a list of known test numbers, such as your office number, your cell

phone, your home number, and co-workers' phone numbers.

For more information, see the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide , Importing and Updating Call Lists.

2 Assign the test list to the autodial campaign in the same way as for outbound

campaigns.

3 Run the campaign with the test list to be sure messages are played as expected.

4 Test the campaign by answering some of the calls and going through the IVR

script, allowing some calls to go to voice mail.

Starting Campaigns

An outbound campaign must be running for you to be able to dial your list of numbers and send calls to agents. When the campaign is running, it does not start dialing until there is at least one agent available to take calls.

A running outbound campaign does not start dialing until at least one agent is available to take calls. If the campaign runs out of numbers to call, the Current Action column contains Waiting for Available Numbers. The campaign remains in a running state. If numbers are activated later (for example, due to dialing restrictions that no longer apply or new list records being added), the campaign starts dialing immediately if agents are available.

The running inbound campaign answers and follows your IVR script when dialing the phone number selected in the DNIS tab. After an autodial campaign is started, it begins dialing depending on the Agent Availability option defined in Dialing Options of the campaign properties. You can use Workflow Rules to start the campaign automatically when defined conditions are true.

Description

Campaign Action

Dialing Campaign is currently dialing.

Campaign is currently unable to make calls because no agents are available. Some calls may still be dialing, in queue, or assigned to agents.

Waiting for available agents

Waiting for numbers

Campaign is currently unable to make calls because no numbers (contact records) are available to dial. Some records may become available later as reminders expire. Some calls that are currently may still be dialing, in queue, or assigned to agents.

Waiting for resources

Campaign is currently unable to make calls because no outbound domain lines or autodial campaign lines are available. Some calls may still be dialing, in queue, or assigned to agents.

Outbound calls are not allowed

Outbound calls are not allowed at the moment. For example, automatic calling is not allowed for a state/province. Some calls may still be dialing, in queue, or assigned to agents. See Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns for more information.

Out of numbers

Campaign can make no calls because no numbers (contact records) are available to dial. No contact records will appear in the future without changing the data, such as adding additional records to the dialing lists or changing the campaign settings or changing some records to satisfy the campaign filters.

Stopping a Campaign

You can stop a campaign in one of these ways:

l Normal stopping: waits for all active calls to end before stopping. The length of

time it takes for the campaign to stop depends on how long the active calls take to complete.

l Immediate stopping: stops dialing numbers immediately and disconnects all

calls in process.

l Automatic stopping: stops automatically when long distance charges are

inadequate, the maximum configured number of dispositions in the campaign profile is reached (see Campaign Profiles), the campaign runs out of numbers to dial, and a workflow rule is triggered (see Managing Disposition Counts in the

25 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

guide.

l Is the campaign running?. The outbound campaign must be running to dial

and deliver calls to agents. In the Campaigns folder, there is Status column where you can see if the campaign is running. If the campaign is not running, right-click the campaign and choose Start. See Starting Campaigns.

l Is the campaign running out of numbers or processing calls that are not

answered?. The campaign stops if it runs out of numbers. Right-click the campaign and select View System Messages to see if the campaign is out of numbers.

It is possible the dialer is processing a lot of numbers that are not connected (busy, no answer). To check the status of the dialer, run the Call Log reports. When you run the report, do not choose any users and do not choose any dispositions. This allows you to see calls processed by the system. Check the Result column for calls with the User name [None]. These calls did not reach an agent. You can see blocks of time where the dialer was busy processing calls that did not reach an agent. It takes at least twenty seconds, by default, to process a no answer call, due to ring time.

Same contacts are called multiple times.

l Are you using the redial disposition?. Redial dispositions instruct the dialer

to call the phone number again. If the dialer is near the end of a list, or if a redial timer is configured for a short, the number may be redialed again in a short time.

Try replacing dispositions redial dispositions (especially those with timers) with ones that do not. You can use the Reset Dispositions to redial numbers based on disposition rather than allowing the dialer to control when the number is redialed.

As a rule, use a redial dispositions only when the agent does not speak to anyone or if a contact asked to be called again.

29 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 481

Creating Campaigns

Troubleshooting Campaigns

l Are you resetting the campaign?. The Reset Campaign feature instructs the

dialer to redial every number again (with the exception of Do Not Call numbers). Normally you should not use the Reset Campaign feature. Use the Reset Dispositions option instead. See also, Renaming Campaigns.

Contact Hangs up Before Reaching an Agent.

l Are you performing call analysis (answering/fax machine detection)?. If

using Fax and Answering Machine Call Analysis in the properties of the Outbound Campaign, be sure to set the Voice Detection Level to Fast. A setting above Fast allows for a longer delay after the person says Hello, which could account for the hang-ups.

If you still get hang-ups when using the Fast setting, try turning off Call Analysis.

Contact Hangs up Immediately After Reaching an Agent.

l Agent not responding quickly enough. Be sure agents start their greeting as

soon as the Incoming Call screen appears. The contact has already answered so the agent should not wait to hear a hello but should start speaking immediately.

High Dropped Call Rate.

l Check the calls-to-agent ratio in campaign properties. Calls to Agent Ratio

for the Power Dialing Mode sets how many phone numbers are dialed for each agent. A high setting could result in a lot of dropped calls. Try reducing the Calls to Agent Ratio or setting it all the way to 1. A setting of 1 dials only one phone number for each agent, eliminating the chance of dropped calls.

l Are you running multiple outbound campaigns?. If you run multiple

outbound campaigns at the same time, check if the campaigns use the same skill groups. If two campaigns dial calls for the same agents, the dialer becomes less consistent, especially if the campaigns use different dialing modes or are completely different campaign types. Try changing the Skill Groups so the campaigns do not send calls to the same agents.

Troubleshooting Inbound Campaigns

Busy signal when calling an inbound campaign.

30 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 482

Creating Campaigns

Troubleshooting Campaigns

l Check to see if the campaign is running

An Inbound Campaign must be running to answer calls. If the campaign is not running, right- click the campaign and select Start <Campaign Name>.

l Check the DNIS tab to be sure the correct number is selected

Go to Campaign Properties and open the DNIS tab. Is the correct number selected? Click Add to view available numbers. Call disconnected when dialing an inbound campaign.

l If you uploaded your own greeting, is it formatted correctly?

Confirm the prompt is in the correct format. The supported format for new files uploaded to the system is WAVE audio, ITU G.711 mu-law, mono 8000 Hz. In some applications it is also listed as CCITT u-Law, 8.000 kHz, 8 bit, Mono, 7 kb/sec.

l Did you update a prompt or greeting?

In the IVR script, open the Play module at the point where the call disconnects. In the Prompt tab, remove the prompt and re-add it. Campaign accepts only one caller at a time. Second caller receives a busy signal.

l Check the maximum number of lines

If the maximum number of lines has been reached, the succeeding callers receive a busy signal. Try increasing the maximum number of lines in the General tab in Inbound Campaign Properties. The default is 1 which limits the campaign to only one call at a time. Increase this setting as needed up to the total number of lines assigned to your account. Customers are not being directed to the correct skill group, agent, greeting, and so on.

l Is the IVR script set up correctly?

Go to Campaign Properties and open the IVR tab. Review the IVR routing. Check the IVR in the IVR Script by right clicking on the IVR Script. Then click <IVR Script> Properties. Verify that the correct skills are associated with the script.

l Are agents logged in and ready?

Check with your agents to ensure they are logged in and ready.

Setting the Maximum Queue Time for Campaign Calls

This is the maximum time that the dialed party is held by the dialer if no agents are available to process the call. After this time expires, the action selected in Action on Max Queue Time Expiration under the Dialing Options tab is taken. See also, Selecting General Settings for Campaign Profiles in the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

l Default value = one second. Do not increase the default value, except in specific

cases, such as when using a dialer to connect calls to remote employees.

l Maximum value allowed by the FCC for dialed calls = two seconds.

l FCC two seconds is counted from the end of the called party's greeting; after

two seconds the call is considered dropped.

l The remaining second is used by Call Analysis, if enabled, and for routing the call

across the network.

Important

The Action chosen for the Max Queue Time Expiration setting impacts the abandon rate calculation.

Five9 offers 3 actions for Max Queue Time Expiration setting. You can configure one one action for a given campaign. Available actions for Max Queue Time expiration setting include:

l Abandon call

l Play prompt

l Play IVR script (advanced)

Note: The abandon rate 2-second rule calculation option allows you to use a queue time of 2 seconds or higher to identify outbound calls as abandoned. The Outbound Campaign Abandon Rate % 2 Seconds Rule standard report shows these values.

This demonstrates how the action configured impacts the abandon rate calculation.

1 When the Max Queue Time expires, and if your campaign administrator has

configured abandon call or play prompt action then Abandon disposition is assigned and call is included in the abandon rate calculation. The dialer

34 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 486

Configuring Campaigns

Outbound Campaign General Properties

maintains the abandon rate calculation as a 30-day rolling average for the Monitor Abandoned Call Percentage feature setting.

2 When the Max Queue Time expires, and if you have configured Play IVR script

(advanced) action, then the disposition configured at IVR script level determines the disposition. Disposition can be abandon or something else. Abandon disposition calls do get counted in abandon rate calculation.

If the disposition set by IVR script is not Abandon disposition then it will result in under reporting the abandoned calls and hence impact abandon rate calculation.

Customers are responsible for configuring these behaviors in a way that best suits their business requirements. Five9 offers custom reporting services to address various configuration approaches and specific customer requests on how to represent abandon rate in historical reporting.

Using Telemarketing Max Queue Time

To comply applicable telemarketing regulations, set a maximum queue time of 1 second.

Note

You must inform the agents to configure their agent desktop for auto-answer on outbound campaign calls to comply with shortened queue times.

Adding an Outbound SMS Number

If your domain is enabled for SMS interactions you can add an SMS number to your outbound campaigns. Any specific number may be added to only one outbound campaign but may be shared with an inbound campaign. You can use this configuration to send outbound SMS when an agent receives a call from an outbound campaign that has an existing SMS-enabled number associated it. When the agent chooses to send an outbound SMS during the call, then the default campaign used is the outbound campaign with an SMS-enabled number. If the outbound campaign does not have an SMS-enabled number, then the last defaulted campaign is used to send an outbound SMS.

Setting Notification to Show Out-Of-Numbers Alerts

Administrators can disable the notification message. This message is displayed to administrators and supervisors when an outbound campaign runs out of numbers to dial. When using Web2Campaign or the Configuration API to add records to a list, campaigns may frequently run out of numbers. In this case, alerts are distracting.

Using Contact Numbers as Caller ID in Third-Party Transfers

When an agent transfers a call to a third party, by default, the domain ANI is sent as the caller ID number. This option enables customers to override the default domain ANI and send the contact's phone number as the caller ID number. The contact’s number is used in these conditions:

l Agents can select Include Caller Info from the transfer window.

l The Use Contact’s Phone Number as Caller ID selection is enabled in campaign

properties.

l For transfers from inbound calls.

Using a Contact’s Number as Caller ID for Third-Party Conferences

When an agent initiates a conference with a third-party, the domain ANI is sent as the caller ID number by default. This option enables customers to override the default domain ANI and send the contact's phone number as the caller ID number.

Ignoring the DNC List for a Campaign

Your DNC list is used in every campaign by default. This option allows you to override this feature and ignore the DNC list for this campaign. If you select this feature, ensure that you remain in compliance with any local, state, or federal regulations. This option is not enabled on domains by default; If you are uncertain about your domain settings, please contact your Five9 representative.

Outbound Campaign General Properties

Using the Campaign in Training Mode

Outbound Campaigns can be run in training mode, which delivers calls to agents without dialing real phone numbers. The system presents calls to agents without dialing the phone numbers, to familiarize new agents with the Five9 Agent application or the procedures to follow for a new campaign. Real campaign behavior is simulated by following dialing restrictions and campaign profile filters. Some features do not work in training mode, such as field mapping, final dispositions across campaigns, and statistics.

Training mode dialing rules:

l List penetration or vertical dialing list dialing mode can be used (see Configuring

Dialing Modes, Options, and Call Processing in Outbound Campaigns).

l All three numbers associated with the contact record are enabled for dialing.

l Calls to Agent ratio is 1-to-1.

l Dispositions do not affect real records. REDIAL, FINAL, or DNC do not affect real

campaign records.

l Campaign simulates real campaign behavior by following dialing restrictions and

campaign profile filters.

Choosing the Campaign Start Mode

Select the mode to start the campaign:

l Basic: Run the campaign without a campaign profile, using default settings.

l Advanced: Run the campaign with a campaign profile. You should create a

campaign profile before using this mode. See also, Selecting General Settings for Campaign Profiles in the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Defining Settings for Calls Transferred to Agents

The ACD (Automatic Call Distribution) algorithm defines how the system selects the next agent who will receive a call. The same option is available in the Skill Transfer Module.

l Longest Wait - All Calls: Selects the agent who has the longest wait (queue) time

for all the calls.

37 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 489

Configuring Campaigns

Outbound Campaign General Properties

l Longest Wait - Non-Manual: Selects the agent who has the longest wait (queue)

time, excluding interruptions for manual calls. For example, an agent becomes Ready at 10:30, and then makes a manual call at 10:33. At 10:45 the agent has been Ready for 15 minutes.

l Round Robin: Selects the first agent from the list of agents for the queue. The

list is initially sorted based on longest wait (queue) time for all calls. The call is delivered to the agent on top of the list. When the agent receives a call, the agent is crossed off the list, and the ACD does not select this agent until all other agents on the list have also received calls for the current round of dialing. When new agents make themselves ready for the queue, they are added to the bottom of the list. An agent who was not available or did not accept an interaction is not offered another interaction until the next round.

l Min Calls Handled: Selects the agent who has received the fewest calls relative

to others based on statistics. The number of calls is taken for the selected time period (see the following option). For example, if you select 8 hours for the Time Frame, then the agents who just started their shift have higher priority to be selected for calls.

l Min Handle Time: Selects the agent who has had the least total handle time for

calls than others, based on statistics. The handle time is calculated for the selected time interval (see the following option). The Time Frame option is defined for Min Calls Handled or Min Handle Time distribution algorithms. You can select from 15 minutes to This day.

Defining the After-Call Work Time Limit

l Enable After-Call work Time Limit: Enable this option if you would like to limit

agents’ wrap-up time (the time between a call being disconnected and the agent selecting a disposition) when working on this campaign.

l Time Limit: Select the time limit for agents in wrap-up mode.

l Set Disposition to: Select the disposition that is automatically set for the call, if

the After-Call Work Time Limit is reached.

l Set Agent to Not Ready: Enable this option if you would like to put agents who

reach the After-Call Work Time Limit for a call to be automatically placed in a Not Ready State, so that they cannot immediately receive more calls.

l Reason Code: If applicable, select the Not Ready Reason Code for agents who

get automatically placed in a Not Ready state, as a result of reaching the After- Call Work Time Limit. For example, you may want to create and assign a Reached ACWTL reason code so that Supervisors are aware of why these agents are Not Ready.

A voice caller and a VIVR caller get the same IVR flow and experience; one uses voice, and the other uses a browser screen. For more information about VIVR, see the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Administrator's Guide.

Setting the Number of Text Interactions This setting runs IVR scripts for chat or email campaigns, limiting how many IVR sessions can run the IVR script concurrently. For example, if 10 customers are in a chat campaign and the number of text channels is set to five, then five of those customer interactions use the script, and the other five route to the chat campaign's default skill without any scripting logic.

Setting the Line Utilization Threshold Use this setting to set an upper limit for the percentage of lines used by this campaign. The default value is set in global configuration window. See Domain Settings in the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Using a Contact's Phone Number as Caller ID for Third-Party Transfers

When an agent transfers a call to a third party, the domain ANI is sent as the caller ID number by default. This option enables you to override the default behavior and to send the contact's phone number as the caller ID.

Defining the Campaign Start Mode

Select which start mode is used when the campaign starts. The following two modes are available:

l Basic: Use this mode to run the campaign with default settings.

l Advanced: Use this mode to run the campaign using a campaign profile. If this

option is chosen, you must select a campaign profile. Before using this mode, first create a campaign profile.

Defining the After-Call Work Time Limit

l Enable After-call work Time Limit: Enable this option if you would like to limit

List Order for Outbound Campaigns Records Order Numbers Order Dialing Rules

List Order for Outbound Campaigns

List priorities may be set in the Campaign Properties window. This feature gives you the power to change the order in which calling lists are dialed. Setting equal priorities enables multiple lists to be considered as one sortable, virtual list, without the need to combine the lists. Setting different priorities for multiple lists in one campaign makes the dialer first go through the list with the higher priority, followed by lists with lower priorities.

Setting a list priority of zero (0) disables the campaign’s ability to dial that list. You may use a priority of 0 if you would like to leave an old list associated with a campaign for reporting purposes, but not dial it. You may also use workflow rules to set a list priority of 0 to temporarily disable dialing of a list, based on certain condition, such as time of day.

If using multiple lists with different priorities, the dialer completes all lists before returning to the top of the first list for a second pass.

If you partially dial one list, stop the campaign, and add a second list with higher priority, the dialer starts at the top of the new list. After completing the new list, it continues with the original list from the position where it left off.

Dialing ratios force the dialer to call records from multiple lists at specified frequencies (number of times). The dialing ratio is an optional function and can be defined in the Campaign Properties. For example, if your campaign has separate lists with hot and cold leads, you may dial hot leads more often than cold ones, without excluding any leads.

While the dialer attempts to dial lists at their configured ratios, the actual number of connected calls may not completely match this ratio, due to factors like call results and list lengths that do not match the configured ratio.

Records Order

If a sort order is not configured in a campaign profile that is associated to the campaign, the dialer dials the list records in the order they are presented in the list. This allows you to control the order in which the list records are dialed in an external application. You can organize the records in your lists in the necessary order, prior to uploading the list. The system follows this order while dialing.

You can use campaign profile settings to set the dialing order of a calling list, based on any of the contact record fields, along with several other functions and variables. See Dial Order, Filtering And Sorting Lists (Campaign Profiles) in the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

The Dialer always remembers the list position even after stopping the campaign. If a campaign is restarted, the dialer returns to that position. It completes the entire list or lists before returning to the top to dial numbers marked for redial.

The list position applies to each campaign. If you move a list to a different campaign, that campaign starts dialing from the top even if another campaign has partially dialed the list. You can use work flow rules to start dialing from the top of the list. See About Workflow Rules in the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

You can also manually reset list position. In this case, the dialing will be restarted from either the first records that were added to the list or from the beginning of a specified sort order. See also Resetting List Position in Outbound and Autodial Campaigns.

Numbers Order

Each contact record can support up to three numbers. You can select one of two possible ways to dial the numbers. With vertical dialing, the dialer attempts to call number 1 in the list, then number 2, and then number 3, before attempting to dial the next record in the list. With list penetration, the dialer attempts to call one number per contact record during each list cycle, and only attempts dialing the next numbers for contact records on subsequent list cycles. See Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns.

Dialing Rules

The dialer uses rules during the automatic dial process and while selecting numbers for dialing.

Skipped Numbers or Records General Dialing Rules

Skipped Numbers or Records Numbers or records can be skipped by the dialer for many reasons:

l Dialing rules exclusions:

o Number does not fit the dial time window set in the campaign profile.

o Another number for the same contact record has already been dialed.

o The same number has been dialed for another contact record.

o State dialing rules exclusions prevent the dial attempt.

l Redial exclusions:

o Maximum number of redial attempts has been reached.

o Redial time-out has not yet expired.

o The number has been assigned a final disposition for this campaign.

l Campaign profile exclusions:

o The number is not enabled in the campaign profile.

o Campaign profile filters specifically exclude this number.

o Campaign list order or dialing mode prevent dial attempts.

l Do not call exclusions:

o The number is on the Do Not Call list.

o The number has been assigned a Do Not Call disposition.

General Dialing Rules

l Each contact record can contain up to three phone numbers.

l The dialer attempts to reach a contact record using any of the provided

numbers.

l The same phone number can be in several contact records, depending on the list

update process used when importing records.

l The campaign stores the state of dialed numbers for each contact record. If

several campaigns use the same contact record, each campaign stores its dial history for attempted numbers from the contact record.

l Each number is assigned a disposition separately. Therefore, a contact record

can have up to three dispositions per campaign. However, depending on disposition type and specific settings, a disposition may affect the entire contact record.

l Each number in the contact record has its own disposition, time stamp when the

disposition was set for the number, and a counter recording the number of dialing attempts.

Campaign Profile Settings. If a campaign has been started in basic mode, the default campaign profile settings are used. Basic mode enables all three phone numbers for dialing (if using multiple phone numbers per record) and sets the dialing hours to 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM.

You can use the advanced mode to run campaigns using custom campaign profiles. Using campaign profiles, administrators can disable phone numbers if using multiple phone numbers per record, set different dialing hours per number, configure list dialing orders, add contact record filters, and configure a number of other options.

Disposition Type. The dialer skips list records if they have been assigned a disposition by Redial or Do Not Dial (DND) for campaign dispositions with enabled timers, and the timers have not yet expired.

Important

Contact numbers updated after a DND disposition has been applied have no dis- position associated and are exempted from the DND timer restrictions.

In List Penetration dialing mode, redial-type dispositions without timers and Do Not Dial Number for Campaign dispositions with expired reactivation timers are dialed, based on their position in consecutive list cycles. In Vertical list dialing mode, the dialer attempts to dial numbers or contacts with expired timers as soon as possible if they are higher in the configured sort order or list position.

The dialer does not retry a number that has already been assigned a disposition and if its disposition does not have Redial or Do-Not-Call (which has timeout and can be dialed) type.

The Dialer does not dial contact records with the following dispositions:

l Final Disposition For Contact Record

l Add Number to DNC List with a selected option:

o Add Active Number and Finalize Record for the Campaign

o Add All Numbers and Finalize Record for the Campaign The dialer also does not dial contact records that have any combination of Do Not Dial Number for Campaign (without a reactivation timer) or Add Number(s) to DNC List dispositions applying to all of the numbers for that contact records. See also, Configuring Dispositions.

Manual Intervention. The dialer does not choose a record if there is a call taking place using a record’s associated number, in cases when one number is associated to multiple records.

Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns

Only the Final Disposition of a manual call affects Dialer behavior with regard to the record. Manual calls do not affect campaign runtime statistics (except Final dispositions).

Available Agents. An outbound campaign in power or progressive mode reserves an agent before making a call. The campaign makes calls to customers for the reserved agents. If a call made for an agent fails, the campaign removes the hold on the agent. The agent can be reserved again by the same campaign or another campaign.

The estimated number of calls at a given time for such campaigns can be calculated by the following formula: Calls to Agents Ratio * Number of Reserved Agents.

Example

Assumptions:

l Campaigns have the same skills.

l Any campaign call can be assigned to any agent.

l Calls to Agents Ratio = 1. 1 Blue campaign is first - it is reserving two agents.

2 It makes calls to customers for the reserved agents.

3 New agent is appearing (go off break).

Call Priority. Call priority is measured on a scale of one to 100, with one being the lowest priority. Call priority determines which calls in queue are answered first. Higher priority calls are typically answered before lower priority calls, regardless of when they enter the queue. Additionally, call priority may also be adjusted in the IVR Skill Transfer module during queue time and affected by your task distribution settings.

Basic inbound and autodial campaigns not using a campaign profile begin with a call priority of 10. Basic campaign outbound calls begin with a priority of 50 for preview dialing mode and 60 for all other dialing methods. Campaign profiles begin with an initial priority of 60 for all call types.

See Creating Campaign Profiles and Setting the Distribution of Interactions in the Five9 Basic Administrator's guide. See also, Skill Transfer Module in the Five9 IVR Administrator's guide.

State Dialing Rules. State Dialing Rules define the dates, days, and times when contact records in a particular State will not be dialed. This feature can be enabled for a campaign in the General tab of the Campaign Properties. See General Dialing Rules.

Statistics. Predictive Dialer Campaigns automatically control the pace of outbound calls, based on several statistics, such as average wrap time (AFTER-CALL WORK TIME), average handle time, and abandonment (dropped call percentage). See Predictive Dialing Mode.

For Power Dialing Mode campaigns with the Monitor Abandoned Call Percentage option enabled, the dialer automatically drops the Calls to Agent ratio to 1-to-1 if the configured Max Abandon Call Percentage is reached. Predictive Dialing Mode campaigns gradually drop the dialing rate if the campaign exceeds its Max Abandon Call Percentage. This change is more subtle than in Power Dialing campaigns.

Changes to Running Campaigns. You may apply some changes to your running campaigns. Read below how changing options influences the dialer.

50 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 502

Configuring Campaigns

Understanding the Dialer in Outbound Campaigns

Any changes to list orders or dialing modes do not affect the behavior of records that have Redial-type dispositions with timers. These records are dialed as close as possible to the scheduled redial times.

Records Order Changed. The administrator can change the Dialing Schedule for a number in Campaign Profile Properties, which may affect the order of dialing records.

The administrator can change the sort order in the campaign profile. In this case, the dialer applies new criteria to the list immediately and start using the new criteria for dialing, from the top of the newly configured list order. See Dial Order, Understanding The Dialer.

New Records Appear. If a record is added to the list while a campaign is in the middle of the list, it considers the record for dialing, according to sort order defined in the Campaign Profile. If the new list record is higher in the sort order than the dialer’s current list position, it is considered for dialing right away. See Adding Contact Record, Editing/Updating Contacts and Importing/Updating Call Lists.

APIs and Web2Campaign list records that arrive with F9CallASAP flags set to true are put into their own special queue, which has higher priority than other list records. The sort order for this ASAP queue is determined independently from the rest of the list in Campaign Profile Properties under Dial ASAP List Record Queue for Web APIs. The available sort orders are:

l FIFO (first in, first out)

l LIFO (last in, first out)

l Contact Record Field(s): Sorts the ASAP queue according to the Order by criteria

configured in the Filter tab of Campaign Profile Properties. In addition to the sort order, you can specify the timeout period for ASAP queue records. If the lead has not been dialed and assigned a disposition during the timeout period, it is moved to the normal list queue and is no longer considered as an ASAP record.

You can also set the number of dial attempts for ASAP record in the Campaign Profile Properties window. This parameter indicates the number of dial attempts for an ASAP record, after which it loses the ASAP flag and gains regular priority. If you are using dial ASAP, the number must be set to 1 at minimum. See also Web2Campaign.

Campaign restarted. If the campaign was restarted without changing the sort order defined in the profile, it continues dialing from the last record before stopping.

Sort Order Changed. If the sort order is changed in the campaign profile properties, the campaign starts calling from the beginning of the list.

List Position Reset Manually. Dialing starts over from either the first records that were added to the list or from the beginning of a specified sort order. The list position can be reset manually or as a result of a workflow rule. For more information, see Resetting List Position in Outbound and Autodial Campaigns.

Configuring Call Recordings

This section applies to all types of campaigns. Call recordings are saved in the user properties of the agents as separate files that have the same session ID as the original call. Recordings are listed in call logs, worksheets, and call segment reports.

Agent Settings Campaign Settings IVR Settings

By default, call recordings are limited to one hour. If your campaigns make or receive calls that may exceed this duration, contact your Five9 support representative to increase the maximum call recording length to up to three hours.

The recording is a WAV file that contains the agents' conversations during the call sessions. The number of calls recorded is determined by the number of recording ports provisioned for your account. By default, an account with five seats has one recording port. An account with ten seats has two recording ports. Therefore, if ten agents are taking calls at the same time, 20% of the calls are recorded.

Predictive Dialing Mode

The predictive dialer automates outbound activities and maximizes agent productivity by ignoring unreachable numbers, such as those with busy signals, operator intercepts, no-answers, and do-not-call numbers, and by automatically adjusting the dialing pace. The dialing pace is determined by the predicted agent availability based on historical and short-term statistics, such as call handle and ring times, percentage of answered

calls, and dropped call percentage for the last 30 days. The dialer attempts to keep the campaign below the configured dropped call percentage. All rules are described in Dialing Rules.

The Predictive Dialing Mode option is designed for contact centers and businesses that regularly perform large numbers of outbound calls. Predictive Dialing mode is an aggressive outbound algorithm that is best suited for high volume outbound environments with a large pool of agents dedicated to outbound activity. Predictive Dialing mode should never be used with less than 15 agents consistently active in the campaign at all times. Agents skilled for a campaign that uses Predictive Dialing should be committed to that campaign, and not be skilled for other campaigns, particularly inbound campaigns. Sharing agents with other campaigns or having inconsistent staffing levels may result in a high number of abandoned outbound calls. Five9 recommends that you consult your Five9 representative before implementation to determine if Predictive Dialing mode is right for your contact center.

Tuning the Predictive Dialer To set the predictive dialing options, use the Abandoned Call Percentage and Call Analysis options.

Calls are presented to agents when they are available. The calls-to-agent ratio is automatically adjusted, which maximizes agent usage while attempting to stay below the configured dropped-call percentage. The dialer automatically paces the number of calls, without reserving agents or waiting for individual agents to be available. Numbers may be dialed in anticipation of an agent becoming available. When reaching the maximum dropped call percentage, the dialer gradually reduces the calls-to-agent ratio to attain an acceptable value.

Several factors can lead to increased numbers of dropped calls, for example:

l Few calls

l Short campaign run-time

l Few agents

l Agents shared across multiple campaigns

l Agents suddenly not ready

Controlling the Dialing Pace Enable Call Analysis to monitor Abandon Call Percentage and Fax and Answering Machine Detection (Call Analysis). Both are optional.

If too many calls are abandoned, adjust the tolerance. The default values are provided to help you remain in compliance with dialing regulations. If you attempt to change the value, you see a warning and a reminder of the default value.

Setting Action on Max Queue Time Expiration When the maximum queue time is reached, you must play a recorded prompt for the caller. The script must give the caller your company name and callback number.

Power Dialing Mode

Use Power Dialing mode when you want to set a fixed Calls-to-Agent Ratio for dialing multiple calls per agent. The dialing algorithm identifies agents as they become available for calls and continuously dials at the configured rate, until live persons are connected with the agents. The dialer automatically detects and filters out unreachable

l Agent usage varies, depending on the configured Call(s)-to-Agent ratio.

l Dialer reduces the Calls-to-Agent ratio when reaching the maximum

abandoned call %: Abandoned call percentage for last 30 days (if Monitor Dropped Call Percentage is enabled) for U.S.-based domains; Last 24 hours for U.K.-based domains. Calls are immediately reduced to a 1:1 call-to-agent ratio if this percentage threshold is reached.

l Campaign statistics control the dialing pace: If the Calls-to-Agent Ratio is set to

a rate that exceeds your account’s maximum number of outbound lines, and depending on how many agents are currently available for calls, the dialing rate at any given time will not exceed your maximum number of lines.

Controlling the Dialing Pace You may also enable the Monitor Abandon Call Percentage option for this dialing mode. If the campaign’s Abandoned Call Percentage for the last 30 days exceeds the configured threshold, the Power Dialer can gradually throttle down to a 1-to-1 Call-to- Agent Ratio, until an acceptable Abandoned Call level is reached.

Keep in mind that the default value is set to help you remain in compliance with dialing regulations. If you change from the default value, you will receive a warning and are minder of the default value.

Using Call Analysis and Detect Fax or Answering Machines Fax and Answering Machine Detection (Call Analysis) is optional.

Note

Five9 recommends that you disable abandoned call monitoring and the calls- to-agent ratio option when using fax and answering machine detection.

Progressive Dialing Mode

Progressive dialing is designed for campaigns that have a relatively high level of agent usage, delivering calls to the agents as they become available. Progressive dialing uses campaign statistics to adjust the calls-to-agent ratio without exceeding the configured maximum abandoned call percentage defined in the default campaign settings (see Default Campaign Settings). Progressive dialing is less aggressive than predictive dialing and is appropriate when fewer than 10 active agents enabled for the campaign.

To configure additional dialing mode characteristics, see Defining the Extended Dialing Strategy.

Preview Dialing Mode

Use Preview Dialing mode as an alternative to the automatic dialing modes to give more control over dialing to agents. Preview Dialing is often used in sales-oriented call center operations, where agents have more frequent and personal interaction with contacts. Preview Dialing mode does not filter undesired call results, such as busy signals or operator intercepts. Instead of automatically dialing numbers from a list and delivering connected calls to agents, an agent receives the contact record before any number is dialed. The agent can review the contact record details before a call is made. Agents can be allowed to skip records which they preview.

Preview Dialing Mode Characteristics

l Preview Dialing option provides support for Extended Strategy List Dialing

Mode: Requires extended strategy to be configured and selected. To manage an extended strategy, see Defining the Extended Dialing Strategy

l Agents receive the contact record before dialing takes place: Agents make

decisions about whether to call a contact.

agents receiving the contact record before dialing takes place: Agents make decisions about whether to call a contact.

o Agent will not have a choice to select a number (primary, alternate 1,

alternate 2) of the contact record number to dial. System will only show a single number which is based on campaign profile and extended strategy settings.

l Workflow rules, dialing rules, dialing hours, list sort order, and contact record

criteria apply.

l Agents can skip contact records: Assign permission to individual users in the

User > Roles tab or to groups of users in User Profiles to allow users to skip records in preview (User Can Skip Contact Records).

l Individual phone numbers are not dialed ahead of delivery to an agent.

Preview Campaign Interrupt Options Preview campaigns can allow contact preview sessions to be interrupted with an incoming call or a skill voicemail that is more important to the business. Agents interrupted with either a call or a voicemail are returned to the preview session after a disposition is set. Preview Campaign Interrupt Options can be set in the Actions > Configure > Other tab or in Campaigns > Configure > Dialing Options tab.

Allow interrupts from calls or Skill Voicemails for the campaign. Set in the Actions > Configure > Other tab.

When set in the Campaigns > Configure > Dialing Options tab, you can inherit what was set in the domain settings or override those settings in the campaign by selecting Calls, Skill Voicemails, or both.

Skipping Records or Forcing Numbers to be Dialed Administrators can configure preview dialing to allow agents to skip records or force a number to be dialed after a configured preview time. The ability to skip records is configured as an agent permission in the Agent Role tab. Dialing rules and other campaign settings apply. When the agent skips a record, a disposition must be selected from the campaign’s configured Decline Preview Record Dispositions, and the system delivers the next record.

Defining the Maximum Preview Time You can configure Preview Dialing to force the record to be dialed after a defined preview time. Presents contact records to agents who may select which number to dial and must manually set No Party Contact dispositions.

Preview Campaign Interrupt Options

Preview Campaign Interrupt can be configured at the domain level or for individual campaigns, depending on business needs. Inherit Domain Settings: Campaign uses the settings defined for the domain. If selected, you cannot specify Calls or Skill Voicemails. Calls (Including transfers): Agent receives incoming calls and transfers from other campaigns or agents to interrupt a contact preview task. Skill Voicemails: Agent receives incoming voicemail messages to interrupt a contact preview task.

Dispositions in Preview Dialing Mode Define the dispositions available to agents when the agent wishes to skip (decline) a previewed record. The default disposition for such cases is labeled as system disposition Declined. You can edit the properties of this system disposition or add a different, custom disposition that can be used in such cases. Examples of custom skip dispositions are Skip - Re-Queue (I do not want to dial this record now but I want to keep it in the list and dial later), Skip - Not Qualified (I do not have enough qualification to dial this number).

When working with preview dialing campaigns, agents initiate the call to the contact. Since some calls are not answered (busy, no answer, and so on), we must provide the agent with dispositions for these unanswered calls. Additionally, Operator Intercept and SIP Response Codes are available as call dispositions. Like other outbound campaigns, preview dialing campaigns have access to a set of system dispositions. Changes applies only to this campaign. The Configuration field for such dispositions displays Custom, instead of Default.

As with predictive dial campaigns, you should add custom dispositions for answered calls.

The disposition type and disposition redial timers are used for preview calls and for declined records. For example, if a decline disposition is configured to redial in five minutes, that record is available for preview again after the redial timeout.

Note

When a Preview Dial campaign is configured to use the Extended Strategy List Dialing Mode, you should avoid the use of disposition types with redial timers. Disposition types with redial timer will take pre- cedence over extended strategy redial configuration if both are con- figured.

Skipping Recodes in Preview Dialing Mode Depending on your configuration, agents may have the option to skip records when working with preview dialing campaigns. When agents skip records, they select a

skipped disposition. Clicking the Dispositions tab makes the Decline Preview Record Disposition(s) section available. This section is only enabled if the Campaign Dialing Mode is set to Preview.

TCPA Manual Touch Dialing Mode

TCPA Manual Touch Dialing mode is available only in domains enabled for TCPA Manual Touch Mode. TCPA domains are generally used for telemarketing campaigns to dial cell phones when the business does not have expressed consent to call customers on their cell phone.

Campaigns are configured in a domain with no other dialing modes available. In the Dialing Options tab for the outbound campaign, you define the maximum preview time before the agent status is changed to Not Ready. This option is a strict version of the Preview Dialing mode: contacts are shown to agents but are not dialed automatically.

By default, agents are required to input all internal and external phone numbers manually. External numbers are not dialed automatically. Agents cannot cut and paste or drag and drop a phone number into the field. When ready to dial an external number, agents must enter the number in the field. After agents have entered the number correctly, the Dial button is activated.

This feature applies to these types of calls, whether or not they are part of a campaign: click-to-dial, call previews, and queue and voicemail callbacks. For queue callbacks, automatic dialing is disabled, and, for outbound calls, automatic answer is disabled. However, using speed dial for internal numbers and transferring calls to third parties do not require manual retyping.

Restrictions Characteristics Skipping Records Removing Contact Records From a Running Campaign

Restrictions You cannot set the dialing mode to force a record to be dialed after a specified preview time is reached.

l Agents have complete control over dialing and setting call dispositions: Any

dialing actions associated with a call to an external number are performed manually.

l Presents contact records to agents who may select which number to dial:

Agents must manually set No Party Contact dispositions.

l Excludes any autodial capability to external numbers: Dialing rules and other

campaign settings apply.

l Agent receives the contact record before any number is dialed: Numbers

cannot be automatically dialed from a campaign list or have connected calls delivered to agents.

l Agent can review the contact record details and must enter numbers manually

to dial: Agents must retype any numbers that will be dialed to external customer numbers.

l Calls to internal numbers, using speed dial to internal numbers, and

transferring to third parties work the same way as in standard Five9 domains: Manual retyping in these cases is not required.

Skipping Records Agents can be allowed to skip records which they preview. The permission is called User Can Skip Contact Records in TCPA Manual Touch dialing mode, and is configured in the Agent role through the Five9 Administrator application.

When the agent skips a record, a disposition must be selected from the campaign’s configured Decline Preview Record Dispositions, and the system delivers the next record.

If the set preview time is reached before the agent dials a number, the agent’s status is set to Not Ready.

No external number can be dialed automatically in the event of a preview timeout.

Removing Contact Records From a Running Campaign An outbound campaign prepares for dialing by placing a selection of contact records from the associated list into cache, typically about 100 numbers. A telephone number that exists in cache may be dialed again during that campaign.

If your list has a lot of numbers that are not answered or you are dialing at a time of day when people are not at home, you may want to set a higher Calls to Agent Ratio. If Calls to Agent Ratio is set too high it increases your dropped call rate (abandoned call percentage).

Abandoned Call Percentage and Max Abandoned Call Percentage: Tracks the campaign’s abandoned call percentage for the last 30 days (U.S.) or 24 hours (EU) or since the last reset using the Reset Dialer’s Abandon Call % option, and slows the Dialer to keep the abandoned call percentage to the level selected with Max Abandoned Call Percentage.

FCC, FTC, and Ofcom regulations refer to dropped calls as abandoned calls. For telemarketing campaigns, adjust the Max Abandoned Call Percentage to match the federal requirements for abandonment. FCC and FTC telemarketing regulations require the abandoned call percentage for a campaign be kept to 3% or less over 30-day periods. Ofcom uses the last 24 hour period (midnight to midnight). For Five9 customers to remain compliant with FCC or Ofcom regulations for abandoned calls in campaigns, custom dispositions are not included in the calculation for the Abandoned Call Percentage. Refer to FCC or Ofcom regulations for current requirements and call abandonment rate calculation. For Power Mode, this setting works with Call to Agent Ratio by dialing fewer numbers at a time if the

Call Analysis

Voice Detection Level. An agent connects to the call after the voice is detected. Adjust the voice detection level to set the accuracy of answering machine detection. A setting at or closer to Fast detects fewer answering machines, while a setting closer to Accurate detects more answering machines. However, the Accurate setting may also increase the delay in delivering a call to an agent or starting your recorded message after the call is answered.

The Voice Detection Level setting is only used when using the Answering Machine IVR module.

The seconds marks on the Voice Detection Level slider indicate the maximum time-out interval, after which a call that is not yet determined to be a person or an answering machine is passed to an agent. In most cases, the Answering Machine Detection system attempts to determine faster than the indicated cut-off period.

Agent Availability. This option allows the Autodialer Campaign to dial only when agents are available to handle calls. If this option is unchecked, the list is dialed continuously regardless of agent availability. Check Dial only, and select Any Agent or a skill. You can select the following conditions to make the autodialer call the dialing list:

l Dial Only if Agents Are Available in the Following Skill Group: The campaign

pauses dialing, based on agent availability, and resumes dialing when one or more agents become available within the skill chosen in the drop-down menu. Select Any Agent to stop dialing if there are no agents available in any skill group.

l Ready to Receive Calls: The dialer dials only if one or more agents are available,

ready, and not on call.

l Ready to Receive Calls or Busy : The dialer dials only if one or more agents are

logged-in and are either ready or busy with another call (on call or wrapping up). In this case agents should not be counted as busy if they are making a manual call and were on break before this.

l Logged In: The dialer dials only if one or more agents are logged in and in any

state. If the configured agent availability setting is met, the Autodial campaign

makes a fixed number of calls, regardless of how many agents are available. There is no Calls to Agent Ratio for Autodial campaigns.

Dialing Rules

Apply dialing rules to outbound and autodial campaigns. The dialer ignores numbers in the specified states during specified days/hours. Dialing rules are configured in the global settings, based on the values in the state contact field. Before using the rules, ensure that the state field is not empty in your lists and that it corresponds to the value specified in Dialing Rules options (see Configuring Dialing Rules).

The descriptions below assume you are using multiple phone numbers per record. You should always use List Penetration Mode if your lists have only one phone number per contact record or if most records have only one phone number.

The Campaign Profile associated to the campaign can influence on how the lists are dialed. In the Campaign Profile settings, you can select which numbers are dialed (Number1, Number2, Number3) and in what order.

Using Vertical List Dialing

In Vertical Dialing mode, the purpose is to reach the maximum number of contacts (CRM records). The dialer attempts to call all numbers in the contact record and proceed to the next record. The goal is to reach each contact as soon as possible. It dials each available number for a list record (unless one of them has reached final disposition) before proceeding to the next record in the list. Choose this mode in these cases:

l If the first number is considered (dialed or skipped) and does not result in a final

disposition for the contact record, the next number is considered immediately.

l After all numbers for the contact are dialed or skipped the system waits the

minimum duration (Configured on the Dialing Options Tab) and try the record again.

l The system considers the contact again as soon as the minimum duration has

elapsed, regardless of list position. 1 The dialer dials all numbers from the first contact record.

Then it proceeds to the second record.

See also, Configuring Dispositions. In reality, the system moves to the following records when dialing for multiple agents.

3 When the last contact record in the list is dialed, the dialer starts a new round

following the above described process.

Using List Penetration Dialing

In List Penetration dialing, the main purpose is process the list quickly by dialing the first phone number for each record before moving to the second phone number. The dialer attempts to call the first number for every contact in the list, then number 2, number 3, etc. List Penetration is the default dialing mode. The goal is to process the list quickly by attempting one number for each record before moving to the second and third numbers.

When to Use List Penetration Dialing The List Penetration Dialing Process Adding Records During List Penetration Dialing

When to Use List Penetration Dialing Use List Penetration dialing when you have only one phone number for each contact record.

l If the first available number in a record is considered (dialed or skipped) and

does not result in a final disposition for the contact record, the next available number is considered on the next pass through the list, even if the minimum duration has not elapsed.

l If all numbers for the contact have been considered (dialed or skipped), and the

contact record is encountered again in list order and the minimum duration has not passed, the record is skipped and considered again on the next cycle through the list.

Configuring Campaigns

Configuring the List Dialing Mode for Outbound and Autodial

l The main difference between vertical dialing and list penetration is vertical

dialing dials the contact immediately after the Minimum Duration has elapsed while list penetration waits until the contact is encountered again in the list.

l However, if a number for a contact is assigned a disposition with a redial timer,

such as the Busy disposition, the system does not move to the next number until that number is dialed again.

The List Penetration Dialing Process

1 During the first cycle, the dialer dials all the records from the contact record

database using the first available phone number from the dialing order specified in Campaign Profile Properties. In the example below, the following dialing order is set: Number1, Number2, Number3.

The dialer starts at number1.

2 For consecutive cycles, the dialer considers the records’ next phone numbers in

the specified dialing order (in Campaign Profile), if they are available, one number per record per list cycle. In the example below, number2 is dialed after the first list cycle.

82 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 534

Configuring Campaigns

Configuring the List Dialing Mode for Outbound and Autodial

Campaigns

3 During the third cycle, number3 is used. In the following example, the number3

field is taken.

4 When all numbers from all records have been dialed or skipped, the dialer starts

the next round with the first available phone number from the dialing order specified in Campaign Profile Properties and repeat the above dialing process, skipping any numbers which have not met the Minimum Duration Before Redialing Number (option on the Dialing Options tab of Campaign Properties).

5 If a record is assigned a final disposition, no further attempts are made on any of

the phone numbers for the record for the campaign.

Note

Although the physical direction of the dialing is vertical in List Penetration Mode, the industry term Vertical Dialing actually refers to

dialing numbers horizontally across.

Example

Adding Records During List Penetration Dialing You can add records during a running campaign without interrupting the campaign. In most cases, the new records are dialed in the current dialing cycle, in the requested order, no more than 15 minutes after insertion into the campaign dialing list.

Following the dialing of newly inserted records, the dialer resumes at the pre-insertion list position to consider the records that have not been dialed in the current dialing cycle. If an outbound campaign that is set for list penetration dialing is out of numbers, it may take up to 30 minutes for the campaign to begin dialing the inserted numbers.

Processing Dialing Lists with an Extended Dialing Strategy

The extended dial plan strategy allows you to reach contacts while they are fresh and during a time span when they are likely to be more important to the business.

The Extended Dialing Strategy is similar to the vertical dialing strategy. It first dials all the numbers for a contact record, before moving to the next record. However, the Extended Dialing Strategy allows you to configure varying recall strategies over time.

The Extended Dialing Strategy allows administrators to specify how often and when to go back and dial important leads again instead of first processing to the end of the list. You can tailor campaigns to prioritize calls based on the importance of each contact to the targeted business goals of that campaign.

This setting takes priority over a lower Activate After timer for Do Not Dial Number for Campaign type dispositions. Numbers with such dispositions cannot be redialed until the minimum duration before redialing has passed. However, a lower Redial Timer for Redial Number type dispositions takes priority. It ignores the minimum duration before redialing until the maximum number of redial attempts for the disposition is reached.

Setting the Time-Out for Redialing Numbers

This setting does not set the wait time between phone numbers for a contact record. However, if two phone number fields for a record are identical, the setting applies to fields. Numbers may be skipped for several reasons, such as being outside the dialing hours or in a do-not-call list.

The main difference between vertical dialing and list penetration is that vertical dialing dials the contact immediately after the minimum time has elapsed while list penetration waits until the contact is encountered again in the list.

In either List Dialing Mode, if a number for a contact is assigned a disposition with a redial timer, the dialer does not move to the next number until that number is redialed. For example, this may occur with the default settings of the Busy disposition, which has a redial timer is.

Vertical Dialing with Number Redial

This option is named Minimum Duration Before Redialing Number. If the first number is dialed or skipped but does not result in a final disposition for the contact record or in a redial disposition with a timer, the next number is considered immediately.

After all numbers for the contact have been dialed or skipped, the dialer wait the minimum time before retrying the record’s first number. The dialer redials or skips the contact as soon as the minimum time for any of the numbers has elapsed, regardless of list position.

If all numbers for the contact have been dialed or skipped, and if the contact record is encountered again in list order, but the minimum time has not elapsed for the number, the record is skipped. It will be reconsidered during the next cycle through the list.

Configuring Call Analysis for Outbound and Autodial Campaigns

Configuring Call Analysis for Outbound and Autodial Campaigns

Use the Call Analysis section of the Dialing Options tab to configure outbound and autodial campaigns to automatically filter answering and fax machine connections and increase the delivery of human interactions to your agents.

Answering Machine Detection (AMD)

AMD optimizes outbound calling campaigns by ensuring that human agents are only engaged for human interactions. AMD is a crucial component in outbound calling systems to save costs and time, and reduce agent fatigue and resources. AMD leverages audio signal analysis to differentiate between calls answered by a human, answering machine, and other devices (for example fax machines).

92 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

Configuring Campaigns

Configuring Call Analysis for Outbound and Autodial Campaigns

AMD Workflow

1 Call Initiation: Your autodial campaign starts the outbound call.

2 Detection: On answer, the AMD module gathers data for the first few seconds.

3 Analysis: The AMD module determines whether the connection is to a human or

other device by using voice pattern, beeps, tone, pitch, cadence, and background noise analysis. Analysis is language agnostic and does not use commonly used phrases in voicemail greetings.

4 Decision and Action:

o Human voice detected: Transfers the call to an available agent.

o AMD and other devices detected: Plays a recorded message, leaves a

voicemail, or hangs up, as set in the Fax Call Analysis options.

Call Analysis Duration Best Practices

The default setting is No Call Analysis. Because the analysis takes some time to perform (up to 10 seconds), using any type of call analysis delays call delivery to agents. If it's important that agents hear the first hello, don't select the Fax and Answering Machine option or use the Fast - 2 sec Voice Detection Level setting.

To use call analysis, select the Fax and Answering Machine option (always enabled for autodial campaigns) and set the Voice Detection Level.

Important: Any change to these settings may result in non-compliance with telemarketing regulations. If you are running telemarketing and cold call campaigns, consult the telemarketing regulations before using this feature. It may be illegal to broadcast messages or you may have to play a Safe Harbor message for abandoned calls.

Based on internal testing and customer feedback, setting the Voice Detection Level from 4.5–10 seconds yields the best call analysis results. Note that longer durations don't make calls take longer to route to agents. The AMD module always connects the call to an agent when it's confident a human voice answered. The AMD module then handles the call accordingly and as quickly as possible.

93 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 545

Configuring Campaigns

Configuring Call Analysis for Outbound and Autodial Campaigns

Important: Call analysis is not a foolproof solution. We recommend using the AMD feature just as a tool to assist in call handling and routing decisions. AMD module analysis performance varies with external factors such audio signal quality, answering machine or voicemail system characteristics, and environmental variables. Voicemail greetings greatly vary in length, content, speech patterns, background noise, and signal quality, making it difficult for the AMD module to classify with the highest level of confidence between live human and answering machine connections.

Voice Detection Level Settings We recommend that you setup test campaigns to try various Voice Detection Level settings to ensure that your outbound and autodial campaigns perform well in your environment.

While the Fast 2-sec setting provides swift decision making and often has very little time for call audio signal pattern analysis, which can sacrifice accuracy compared to a longer analysis, some percentage of connected calls always result in false negatives, where a call is incorrectly identified as answered by a human. By using the Fast 2-sec setting, you are prioritizing speed and efficiency over AMD accuracy, which is a great factor in contact center environments where minimizing call handling times is critical.

The Normal - 4.5 sec setting strikes a balance between the need for accurate classification and minimizing call handling time. By analyzing the audio signal for a reasonable duration, the AMD module can make timely classification decisions while still capturing enough information to accurately differentiate between human and machine responses. The Normal - 4.5 sec setting provides efficient and reasonably accurate classification of connected calls, and helps optimize call handling processes. We recommend using this setting to get started.

The Accurate - 10 sec setting places focus on accuracy and precision. Ten seconds provides the AMD module time for a more thorough analysis of the call audio signal, which can result in more accurate determinations of whether the connection is human or machine. This reduces the chance of misclassifying calls, leading to more appropriate routing or handling. With a longer analysis time, the AMD module has more data for an informed decision. This reduces false positives, where a call is incorrectly identified as answered by a machine, and missed opportunities for direct customer interactions.

To configure outbound and autodial campaigns to automatically filter AMD calls:

1 Open the Campaign Properties for your campaign, and select the Dialing

Options tab.

2 Set the Call Analysis options.

o Fax Detection Only: The AMD module disconnects fax machines but

forwards AMD and humans connections to agents.

o Fax and Answering Machine: The AMD module removes fax and most

AMD connections. On connection, the AMD module voice analysis determines whether it's a person or recording. A recording causes the AMD module to hang up without sending the call to the agent. You can play audio prompts or IVR scripts for answering machines and abandoned outbound calls on Max Queue Time Expiration.

Select from these options in the Action on Answering Machine Detection menu:

– Abandon Call: By default, the dialer hangs up without leaving a message. The Abandon call option displays as Drop Call for AMD and Abandon Call for Max Queue Time Expiration, and are correctly reported as abandoned calls.

– Play Prompt: Select the prompt to play.

– Play IVR Script (Advanced): Select the IVR script to run. You can configure your campaigns to automatically leave answering machine messages without having to connect an agent to the call, and use dynamic information (such as speaking the name of the contact, using TTS) in IVR scripts. Use this feature for advanced outbound communications to contacts.

Select the audio prompts or IVR scripts to use Action on Max Queue Time Expiration for Safe Harbor messages or advanced outbound communications for contacts with an existing business relationship. The queue time expiration results in abandoned and dropped calls. This occurs when a dialed number connects but no agents are available to accept the call. Calls may be abandoned when dialing multiple lines per agent. For option details see, Outbound Campaign General Properties.

Configuring Campaign Priority and Ratio Settings

Campaign priority and ratio are optional features that enable you to manage your outbound campaigns based on their importance in your business. To use these features, they must be enabled in the Campaigns tab of the configuration menu of the VCC Administrator application.

To enable these settings in your outbound campaigns, select the Dialing Options tab. You may also create work flow rules based on time or events to automate the changes in modes, priorities, and ratios.

Configuring Campaign Priority Configuring Campaign Ratio Combining Campaign Priority and Ratio

Note

Campaign priority takes into account the number of agents when calculating call-to-agent ratio. Therefore, priority is applied more precisely when many agents are available instead of few agents. For optimal performance, use campaign priority and ratio settings in campaigns staffed with 10 or more agents.

Configuring Campaign Priority and Ratio Settings

Configuring Campaign Priority

You can prioritize when your running outbound campaigns are dialed based on the business value of each campaign. Changes to campaign priority are implemented as soon as you save your changes. The default campaign priority (3) is automatically assigned unless you apply a different one. You are prompted to reset the priority whenever you start the campaign. You may assign a priority from 1–99.

Example

Campaign A priority = 1. Campaign B priority = 3. Campaign A is dialed until no numbers can be dialed immediately; campaign B is dialed in the same manner. Depending on the availability of numbers, the dialer alternates between campaigns as needed.

However, priorities may be ineffective for multiple campaigns where a wide difference in the number of skilled agents.

Configuring Campaigns

Configuring Campaign Priority and Ratio Settings

Example

Campaign A with priority 1 has one available agent. Campaign B with priority 3 Skill2 has 10 available agents.

Campaign A makes a call. Its one agent is busy. In the meantime, campaign B starts to make calls and continue until campaign A is ready to make another call. When the agent in campaign queue A finishes the call, campaign A makes another call. Although campaign B has lower priority, it is busier because it has 10 agents. Priority is ignored if the campaign has only one agent.

Configuring Campaign Ratio

You can assign dialer resources spent on your running outbound campaigns based on their importance in your business. Changes to campaign ratio are effective immediately. The default setting for campaign ratio is 50 when campaign ratio is enabled in your domain. The range is 1–99.

If you use campaign ratios, you must assign a ratio to the campaign before running it the first time. Otherwise the default ratio of 50 is assigned. You are prompted to reset the ratio whenever you restart the campaign.

Example

l Campaign A ratio = 60.

l Campaign B ratio = 50.

l Campaign C ratio = 20. 130 dialing attempts are made:

l Campaign A: 46% of dialing attempts (60/130)

l Campaign B: 39% of dialing attempts (50/130)

l Campaign C: 15% of dialing attempts (20/130)

Dialing ratios may be ineffective for multiple campaigns when a wide difference exists in the number of agents that are to the queues of the campaigns.

Example

l Campaign A: queue 1 and dialing ratio = 20

l Campaign B: queue 2 and dialing ratio = 60

Combining Campaign Priority and Ratio

You can combine campaign priority and dialing ratio to specify how the dialer should distribute calls of multiple campaigns with the same, or different, priorities.

The main goal of the outbound dialer is to generate enough traffic to keep all the agents busy without exceeding your maximum calls abandoned percentage criteria. Keeping in mind the goal of the dialer, the concept of combining ratio and priority is simply to give a campaign with the highest priority/ration the chance to be the first campaign to generate calls. This basic reasoning also assumes that all the campaigns considered have the same amount of agents logged in and ready.

When that campaign with the highest priority cannot generate sufficient traffic then the next highest campaign has the opportunity to place calls, and so on. Additionally, there are several reasons why a campaign may not generate enough calls, such as:

l A campaign is out of numbers to dial

l A campaign has no numbers to dial at the moment, but some may become

available later for these reasons:

o State dialing rules

o Redial timers are assigned to numbers

o Do Not Dial timers are assigned to numbers

o Filters that are configured in the campaign profile

l A higher priority campaign does not yet have enough calling statistics compared

to a lower priority campaign. This typically happens with a recently started campaign, which cannot dial aggressively due to this deficiency in statistics.

l A higher priority campaign is close to reaching the Max Abandon Call criteria,

this causes the dialer to slow down resulting in lower priority campaigns placing calls.

100 Campaign • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 552

Configuring Campaigns

Configuring Time Zone Dialing Options

The dialer always tries to maintain agent load before campaign priority and ratio, allowing lower priority campaigns to place calls when higher priority campaigns are unable to create sufficient traffic.

Example

You want to spend all efforts on Campaign A and Campaign B but commit the greater ratio of efforts to Campaign B until Campaign A and Campaign B are out of numbers:

Campaign Priority Ratio Description

Campaign A 1 20 Campaigns A and B are dialed until all available records are dialed. Campaign B 1 80

Campaign C 2 20 Campaigns C and D are dialed only when campaigns with priority 1 no longer have records to dial. Campaign D 2 80

The feature allows post-call surveys in the IVR. Start by creating an IVR script with survey questions, using call variables where desired to track answers. At the end of the campaign the call is forwarded to another inbound campaign. When agents end calls, callers are transferred to an inbound campaign, based on Survey Execution Condition.

Important

If no skills are added to a campaign the interactions are assigned to any available agent.

Skill Groups for Outbound Campaigns

Select the Skills tab to add to add one or more skill groups to the campaign. The skill groups added here determines which agents receives calls from this campaign.

If multiple skill groups are loaded for the campaign, the agents in the skill group listed first receives the first calls. If they are on a call, the dialer sends calls to the agents in the next skill group. Move skill groups up or down in priority by using the Up and Down buttons.

For routing calls to available agents, the order of the skill groups in this tab takes the highest priority, followed by skill levels that are configured per agent in User Properties, and then followed by the Distribution Algorithm configured in the General tab of Campaign Properties.

To add skill groups, see Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide , Adding Skill Groups.

Outbound Skills for Inbound and Autodial Campaigns

When making a manual call (any call initiated by the agent), the Five9 agent is prompted to associate the call with a campaign. Doing so assigns all of the campaign properties to that call, including the script, worksheet, and dispositions.

If you would like to make this Inbound Campaign available in the list of campaigns that can be associated with manual calls, add a skill group in the Outbound Skills tab. Any agent who is a member of the selected skill group(s) can associate manual calls with this campaign.

Configuring Dispositions

For more information on configuring dispositions, see Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide, Dispositions.

Note

You can also assign, and group, dispositions in campaign profiles. If a disposition is in a group in a campaign profile, and you assign the same disposition to a campaign that associated with that profile, the disposition still appears in the list of available dispositions in the agent application. However, it appears at the top of the list rather than in the group. Five9 recommends that you assign a given disposition either in the campaign profile or in a campaign, but not both.

Disposition Categories

l System Call Disposition(s): The system dispositions are displayed in the System

Call Disposition(s) area. You may edit the Properties of these dispositions to change the dialing behavior for this campaign. For example, one campaign may have a redial timer of 5 minutes for the Busy system disposition, while another campaign may use a 10 minute timer, depending on its requirements.

l Call Disposition(s): These dispositions may be set by agents at the end of calls to

determine its outcome. For outbound campaigns, you may need to create different dispositions for inbound calls if you do not want cross-campaign disposition types (such as, Final type with Apply to Campaigns Using This Disposition selected) to affect the same records in your outbound campaigns.

l Decline Preview Record Disposition(s): Applies to only to outbound campaigns.

Depending on your configuration, agents may have the option to decline records, without calling a number, when working on Preview Campaigns. For this case, you should define the Decline dispositions. The following tasks can be performed for each list:

l Add: Opens the Select Disposition(s) window where you can choose one or

several existing dispositions to add.

l Remove: Removes the selected dispositions from the list.

l Edit: Opens the Disposition properties window where you can change the

disposition settings. If you change default settings, the Configuration field in the dispositions table changes from Standard to Custom.

l Restore Defaults: Reverts any changes made to dispositions for this campaign to

their global (default) configurations. On the Dispositions tab, you can select one of these options for Conference calls:

l Agent who initiates conference must disposition call: Requires that the first

agent in a conference that contains at least one other agent to set a disposition when leaving the conference.

l Last Agent to leave conference must disposition call: Requires that the last

agent who is left in a conference that contained at least one other agent to set a disposition when leaving the conference.

l Conference initiator decides who must disposition call: Provides the ability for

the first agent in a conference that contains at least one other agent to either set a disposition when leaving the conference, or to pass on the disposition- setting responsibility to another agent who is on the call.

Assigning Dispositions to Campaigns

Depending on your configuration, agents may have the option to decline records when working with preview campaigns. For this case, you should define the Decline Preview Record dispositions.

1 In the Dispositions tab, for each section, click Add.

For the Preview Campaign Dialing Mode, the Decline Preview Record Dispositions area include the Declined system disposition. If you want to use only custom Declined dispositions, you may remove.

Editing Dispositions for Each Campaign

You can use the Edit button to open a Disposition Properties for Campaign window for any system disposition or custom dispositions that are added to a campaign.

For example, you may wish to change the Redial timer for the Busy disposition to be 5 minutes for one campaign, and 10 minutes for another campaign.

Any changes made to dispositions in this manner do not apply to other campaigns in which the Disposition is used, or to the global disposition settings. If any changes are made to dispositions for a campaign, the Configuration column in the Dispositions tab display Custom, instead of Default.

You can use the Restore Defaults button to undo the custom disposition configurations for the campaign, and restore the System, Call, or Decline dispositions to their default, global configurations. On the Dispositions tab, you can define which party (conference initiating Agent or last Agent) must define the Disposition after the Conference call.

You can also allow the conference initiator to decide who must disposition the call. In this case, the initial agent may either set a disposition when leaving the conference, or instead select another agent in the conference who becomes responsible for setting a disposition or passing the ability to another agent.

Using Contact Record Field Values in Worksheets

You to add contact field values in worksheet questions. Worksheets support specifically formatted text, called replacement parameters, which are replaced by contact data at runtime. To replace text in the question text area of a worksheet, add a replacement parameter tag that pulls contact data for the connected call. Any contact field may be used in this format: @Customer.<field_name>@

For example, if you want the text to read: Dear Mr./Mrs. Johnson, add this to your call script: Dear Mr./Mrs. @Customer.last_name@

When the worksheet is loaded with the contact record for the call, the text @Customer.last_name@ is replaced with the data in the last_name field of the contact record.

Instead of creating a worksheet question that reads Hello Mr / Mrs LAST NAME, the system adds the name of the customer who is on the phone, making worksheets more dynamic. All variable names are case sensitive.

To determine which variables are available in your domain, go to Contacts > Fields. Below are the Five9 default (system) contact fields: number1, number2, number3, first_name, last_name, company, street, city, state, and zip. Any contact field, including your custom fields, can be put into a worksheet. You only need to determine the exact field (variable) name, such as @Customer.last_name@

You can also use @Worksheet.questionname@ for previous worksheet values, where questionname is the name of a previous question. If you are using a test worksheet in Campaign Properties, the replacement parameters are not populated because it is not associated with a specific record. You cannot use a replacement parameter in the first question of the worksheet.

Configuring Scripts

The script is the first screen displayed to the agent when a call is presented. The script is the sales pitch the agent reads when a call is connected or notes to help the agent while on a call.

Using Contact Data in Scripts

Below you can find the steps for using contact data fields to personalize scripts. Instead of writing a script that says hello FIRST NAME, the script adds the name of the contact, for example: Mr. Thomas, thank you for taking my call. Do you have a few minutes?

To use contact fields in a script, you must save the script as HTML and edit the HTML code. You can edit the code in a text editor or an HTML editor before importing it into the campaign, or you can edit the code after importing.

1 For a list of fields available to use in your script, click Contacts > Fields.

The default contact fields, number1, number2, number3, first_name, last_name, company, street, city, state, and zip, and any custom contact fields are available.

2 Be sure that the field names to be used are populated in the contact database

from one or more lists.

3 Save your script as an HTML file or as a Web page or Web Page Filtered.

4 Edit the HTML file in a text or HTML editor.

Add text in the code for the contact fields you want to insert in the script. Field names are replaced with the contact data from the contact record. Any contact field may be used in this format: @Customer.<field_name>@

For example, if you want the text to read: Dear Mr./Mrs. Johnson, add this to your call script: Dear Mr./Mrs. @Customer.last_name@

7 To view the script, click Preview.

This view does not have the contact data populated in the script because there is no active contact record. Use the Agent application to fully test the script.

An alternative to use the @Customer.<field_name>@ for automatically replaced contact field values is using custom HTML tags. Below are the HTML tags for the default contact fields. Note that the uppercase text can be different from what is shown here. This text is shown when the script is being tested.

<a id=number>PHONE NUMBER</a> <a id=first_name>FIRST NAME</a> <a id=last_name>LAST NAME</a> <a id=company>COMPANY NAME</a> <a id=street>ADDRESS</a> <a id=city>CITY</a> <a id=state>STATE</a> <a id=zip>ZIP CODE</a>

Managing Prompts

Use this tab to set up prompts to be played to the agent on call connection and when the caller is on hold. Whisper prompts replace standard beeps and ring tones and provide agents with the context they need to respond appropriately to the caller. You must restart the campaign to activate the new hold music. If the hold time for a call exceeds the length of the configured hold music prompt, the music is repeated.

Call Whisper

This feature allows the agent to hear a custom prompt (for example, saying the name of the campaign or skill) instead of standard beeps and ring tones. Prompts provide agents with the information they need to respond appropriately to the caller. If the Call Whisper feature is set up, the agent should hear a specific campaign or skill whisper as the call is connected. See Managing Voice Prompts in the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Note

A whisper prompt set for a skill overrides a whisper prompt set for a cam- paign.

Hold Music

Hold music is one or several audio files which are played to the callers when they go on hold. For example, if you use the Agent/Voice mail Transfer or Skill Transfer IVR

module, the connected party hears hold music while waiting for an agent. When the agent uses the Place Call On Hold function, the caller hears the hold music until this call is retrieved.

Your custom hold music can include music in addition to a recorded message such as a marketing message. For example, you may want to provide information about your company or product.

The custom hold music must be saved as a prompt. Five9 recommends keeping the length of hold music files to less than 3 minutes. The file continues to play in a loop as long as the caller is on hold. You must restart the campaign to activate new hold music.

The Five9 VCC provides default hold music. You can override the default hold music by adding a new recording. You can select from either custom or default prompts. Recordings used for hold music must be uploaded under the Prompts folder in the Administrator application.

Defining the Maximum Number of Lines

The maximum number of lines that you set for inbound campaigns determines how many people can call your campaign at one time. This includes talking to an agent, on hold, conference calls, or if the call is still being routed by an IVR script. Use this option to set the number of inbound lines allocated to a campaign. In the General tab, set the Max Number of Lines to be dialed by the campaign. When defining an autodial campaign to deliver calls to an agent, limit the number of lines to the number of agents that are available during the call time, plus the number of contacts to be placed on hold. The campaign can stop dialing based on agent availability and when all the configured lines are in use. See also Autodial Campaigns General Properties.

The default value is 0. After opening the campaign properties for the first time, you must change this value to a number greater than 0 before saving the campaign. If the number of calls to the campaign exceeds the maximum, subsequent callers hear a busy or fast busy signal or sometimes a voice announcement. The actual experience depends on your telecom provider.

You may want to dedicate specific numbers of inbound lines to each campaign. Alternately, you can set all inbound campaigns to the total number of lines available. Therefore, to prevent callers from receiving a busy signal, be sure to order enough inbound lines to cover your peak usage. Your Five9 domain is provided with a fixed number of lines. To add inbound lines, contact your Five9 account manager.

Setting Agent Availability

In the Dialing Options, if your call flow includes the potential to deliver calls to agents, you must consider starting and stopping the campaign based on the availability of agents. You can use the Agent Availability option for the Autodial Campaign to automatically start dialing only when there are agents available. See Autodial Campaigns General Properties for option descriptions.

Agent availability enabled. If the option is enabled, you can select any agent or a skill group in Dial Only if Agents Are Available in the Following Skill Group. The campaign

stops dialing if no agents available in the selected skill group. You must define the conditions under which the agents are considered available:

l Ready to Receive Calls

l Ready to Receive Calls or Busy

l Logged In The campaign can stop dialing automatically if no agents available or the number of lines configured on the General tab is reached.

The Autodial Campaign dials the number of lines configured on the General tab even if only one available agent remains in the skill group. The remaining agents need to process the calls on all lines assigned to the Campaign. The number of lines does not change depending on number of available agents. For example, if you have 10 agents in the skill group and the autodial campaign has 10 lines, but only one agent is ready, the campaign dials 10 lines for that agent.

If an agent goes on break or logs out after autodial has placed a call, the contact reaches the IVR and is processed as if no agents are available.

Agent availability disabled. If the option is disabled, the autodial campaign dials a list based on the number of lines available, regardless of the number of logged-in or available agents. The list is dialed continuously, regardless of agent availability. Therefore, you need to start the campaign only when agents are available or to provide an option for voice mail when no agents are available.

Providing a Message When Agents are Unavailable

Always provide a message if no agents are available even if you enable Agent Availability. For example, the autodial campaign sees that an agent is available and starts to dial for that agent. Before an answered call is delivered to the agent, the agent goes on break. The message can be played immediately after a call is answered or after checking a skill group first. Below are sections of an IVR flow demonstrating both options.

The Play module is first in line with a message stating the reason for the call and then uses a Skill Transfer module to check for agents.

The first Skill Transfer module checks for an agent, with no queue time. If no agents are available, it immediately plays a message using the Play module. After the message has been played, the call is sent to a second Skill Transfer module.

The first Skill Transfer module should be set up with no queue time. If no agents are available, the person hears the message in the Play module before being put on hold. The settings for the first Skill Transfer module are displayed below.

If a call is answered but there are no agents available to immediately take the call, play a message informing the person why you are calling. In other words, do not put the call on hold before stating the reason for the call.

After the Play module, there is a second Skill Transfer module to transfer the call to one or more skill groups. If the call is transferred to an agent in a skill group, the IVR Script is complete. You can set a hold time if no agents are available. The caller hears hold music while waiting for an agent.

Using the Priority Setting in IVR Modules

In the second example above you want to ensure that the calls waiting on hold are answered before any new calls. The people on hold are obviously interested in talking to an agent. You can accomplish this by using the Priority setting in the second Skill Transfer module. Calls with a higher priority are answered before other calls.

In the properties of the second Skill Transfer module select the Priority tab, click Increase Priority By, and set the value to 1.

Dedicating Skill Groups to Campaigns

Dedicate a group of agents to the Autodial Campaign. Use a Skill Group to assign your agents to the campaign. Agents working in an Autodial Campaign should not participate in other campaigns at the same time. Stop the Autodial Campaign when you want to switch the agents to another campaign.

Setting the Fast Voice Detection Level

Use the Fast Voice Detection Level setting (the Dialing Options tab in the Autodial Campaign Properties window). Agents are connected to calls with more answering machines, but the setting decreases the delay in connecting the calls after saying hello.

Configuring Email Notifications

In the E-Mail tab, you can set for each campaign an email address for maintenance notifications that can affect your campaign. You can use a different email address for each campaign or type of campaign.

Configuring Voice Mail Notifications

You can send an email notification when an agent or other user receives a message. Depending on the configuration, the email message can be an attachment.

When a message is delivered to a user account, the system sends a message to the email address configured in the user account properties. The user account can be any

account that receives messages, such as agent accounts or accounts selected to receive messages in an inbound IVR. An IVR script can be configured to send calls to a specific voice mailbox outside of business hours. In this case an email notification can be sent to an on-call or after hours email address. The messages can be managed even if there are no users currently online. Messages attached to emails can be reviewed without user access or without logging in to the VCC.

Agents can receive messages when a call is transferred from another agent, from an IVR script, or from an extension transfer in an IVR script. For each user account, you can select if an email message is sent when a message is received. You must enter a valid email address in the User Properties window. You may also configure an error handling email address in Actions > Configure, which is used as the Reply To address. See Managing Voicemail (Users).

The email message has a subject line of Five9 Voicemail Alert and includes the phone number of the caller and the time and date it was received. If the source number does not provide Caller ID, it appears as Unknown Caller.

Ensure that the recipient’s email server accepts messages with attachments and that the file size limitation is configured to allow a WAV file larger than one megabyte. If the receiving email server imposes a limit on attachment size, and the message exceeds this limit, the email is delivered without the attachment. In this case, the message remains in the voice mail recording section of the user account properties.

If a message delivery fails (bounces), the failure notification message is sent to the error handling email address. A copy of the message remains in the User account properties and can be accessed from the agent, supervisor, or administrator applications.

A message can be transferred to another agent. When a message is transferred, an email is sent with this subject, Five9 Voice Mail Transfer Alert, which contains the name of the administrator that transferred the message, the date and time, and the source phone number of the message.

Voice mail notification enables users to check general or group messages for inbound campaigns. Many times an IVR branch ends with a caller leaving a message for a department or group rather than for an individual. For example, you may have an IVR branch that delivers calls to support agents. If an agent does not pick up the call after the specified hold time, the caller can leave a message for a fake user account, used primarily as a general voice mailbox. With email notification, this message can be distributed:

l Sent to an email distribution list for all support staff

l Sent to a shared email box where support staff pick up the messages

l Sent to a support manager who distributes the messages based on the content

Resetting List Position in Outbound and Autodial Campaigns

Resetting List Position in Outbound and Autodial Campaigns

By default, the dialer attempts dialing all the records in the lists before starting over from the top of the list order. Resetting the list position forces the dialer to start from the top of the list at the desired moment of time. The dialing is started over from either the first records that were added to the list, or from the beginning of a specified sort order. See also, List Order for Outbound Campaigns. You can also reset list position automatically on the scheduled time by using workflow rules (see Dialing Rules.

In some cases, you may need to make the dialer start dialing from the beginning. You and supervisors can manually reset the dialing list position. Resetting the list position is logged in the Event Log.

The dialer remembers the list position even after stopping the campaign. If a campaign is and restarted, the dialer returns to that position. Unless the list position is reset, it completes the entire list or lists before returning to the top and starting to dial numbers marked for redial without a timer.

The list position is maintained for each campaign. If you move a list to a different campaign, that campaign starts dialing from the top even if another campaign has partially dialed it.

If you partially dial one list, stop the campaign and add a second list with higher priority, then the dialer will start at the top of the new list. After completing the new list, it will continue with the original list at the position where it left off.

Warning

This feature erases all dialing results and some reporting information.

There are several exceptions that would cause a record to be dialed seemingly out of order. Usually, this would happen because of a Redial-type Disposition with a timer.

1 Click the Campaigns folder. 2 Right-click a campaign name, and select Reset List Position.

Interactive Voice Response

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) enables human-computer interaction for inbound (required) and autodial (optional) campaign calls. IVR scripts can range from simple announcements to complex multi-prompt customer service menus that can perform many functions, such as these:

l Route incoming calls according to the availability of agents or skill groups

l Transfer calls to a third party or voicemail when agents are not available

l Provide instructions to callers

l Search for contact records

l Assign data to variables Interactive Voice Response is available in these options:

l Visual mode: Visual IVR is an optional feature in your Virtual Contact Center. For

more information, contact your Five9 representative.

The Visual IVR feature is an self-service interface that enables you to provide on your Web site a visual interface on any device, such as a smartphone. This interface enables your callers to click or touch menu items without having to listen and respond verbally to each option. To interact with an agent, callers can choose among the contact options that you offer, such as phone, Five9 Email, and Five9 Chat. To integrate Visual IVR in your workflow, see Visual IVR Scripts.

l Voice mode: The conventional voice mode enables you to use recorded

messages as prompts and to create prompts specific to your needs. You can use a text-to-speech builder and speech recognition. For more information, see Adding Prompts and Speech Recognition Grammars.

l Touch-tone keypad mode: The default mode enables customers to use a touch-

tone phone to interact with your company.

You can use a script in several campaigns, you can link small scripts to create a large one, and you can use several scripts in the same campaign. You can export and import IVR scripts to create a customized version for a different campaign. You can access IVR information in reports. IVR scripts can contain diverse components, such as speech recognition, linked modules, and variables.

Visual IVR Scripts

Five9 Visual IVR is an optional feature of your Virtual Contact Center that provides to your mobile customers an alternative to voice-only IVR flows. For more information, contact your Five9 representative.

Introduction Planning Your Implementation Preparing Your Inbound Campaigns Integrating a Visual IVR Script in Your Web Site Preparing Visual IVR Scripts

Introduction

With Visual IVR, you can convert complex voice IVR prompts into a convenient visual flow that improves customer experience. You can use Visual IVR scripts in many cases, such as these:

l Viewing and paying a bill.

l Obtaining information, such as searching an FAQ.

l Requesting customer support.

l Changing hotel or restaurant reservations.

l Associating skill groups with campaigns to transfer Visual IVR transactions to the

chat sessions available to the skill groups.

l Pass data, such as location, customer’s information, and product information

Benefits

When callers use a mobile device, the convenience of navigating through such a visual IVR flow results in these many benefits:

l For your business:

o Self service results in fewer calls when you implement Visual IVR on Web

pages that customers reach to obtain support, such as billing and FAQ pages.

o Fewer calls are abandoned when compared to traditional voice IVR flows.

14 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 615

Visual IVR Scripts

Introduction

o Fewer calls are transferred to agents because callers can provide precise

context due to the choices available in the IVR flow.

o First-call resolution is increased because agents can communicate rapidly

and efficiently with customers by callback, Five9 Chat, or Five9 Email.

o Style and language in the Visual IVR are consistent with your brand and

customer satisfaction criteria.

l For callers:

o Self service is available at all times regardless of the device and location.

o Callers can choose the contact method by your agents without waiting on

hold when the voice option is not convenient.

Implementation

Visual IVR is simple to implement and manage by using the same drag-and-drop tools that you are already using for voice IVRs. Depending on your configuration, Visual IVR may include estimated wait time, callbacks, Five9 Chat, Five9 Email, and Five9 Visual Customer Feedback. At the end of the Visual IVR flow, Five9 Visual Customer Feedback helps you to measure customer satisfaction when the customer’s sentiment is most relevant and accurate.

Reports

Easy-to-use survey options and out-of-the-box reports enables you to monitor how your customers feel and resolve problems. With real-time and historical reports, administrators and supervisors can easily monitor the results and refine the Visual IVR flows.

Use Cases

Contacting Customer Support This example shows a typical Visual IVR flow in which a customer contacts Five9 to discuss an issue with an agent. In this case, the caller choose to be contacted by phone by an agent.

15 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 616

Visual IVR Scripts

Introduction

After clicking the contact button, the caller is led through a series of visual prompts. Each figure below shows how the caller progresses rapidly through the Visual IVR. When the caller closes the window, an agent who has the appropriate skill will return the call within one minute. Each IVR page is displayed on the entire screen of the customer’s device.

For the IVR modules used to create this flow, see Creating Visual IVR Scripts.

Creating Multilingual Elements You can combine elements to offer dynamic menu options, such as language preference or a custom list of routing options based on skill preference or customer status. A custom tag enable you to render your desired look and feel based on the JSON response received from these Visual IVR modules:

Visual IVR Scripts

Planning Your Implementation

Evaluating Your Current Strategy

To decide the best approach to implement Visual IVR on your Web site, you need to review your current self-service and mobile strategy. Start by answering these questions, but be sure to add any others that are important to your brand and customer satisfaction criteria:

l What are your goals?

l Do you use a self-service voice IVR?

l Do you have usage data about customer visits to your Web site?

l Do multiple groups in your company use or are considering using a Web self-

service IVR? Once you know the answers, you can create an overall plan.

Assigning Implementation Roles

Visual IVR is hosted by Five9. You only need to enable campaigns and configure your Web site. Several members of your organization need to collaborate in the implementation:

l VCC administrator:

o Creates scripts specifically for Visual IVR or modifying existing voice IVR

scripts. For more information, see Preparing Visual IVR Scripts.

o Enable new or existing campaigns for Visual IVR as follows:

– Associate the IVR script in the campaign. – Set the nuber of ports available for the Visual IVR. – Configures one or more schedules. For more information, see Preparing Your Inbound Campaigns.

l Branding and Marketing:

These teams decide the look and feel of the Visual IVR and its location in your Web site. You may choose among several themes and modify these themes if needed.

l Product Development:

This team integrates the Visual IVR in your Web site. For more information, see Integrating a Visual IVR Script in Your Web Site.

Visual IVR Scripts

Planning Your Implementation

Testing the Visual IVR

Before releasing the Visual IVR, you need to test its effectiveness. On the Internet, you can find tools that can help you to understand the value of a Visual IVR and how to optimize it for your business.

1 Add access points, such as a links or buttons, in multiple locations on your Web

site.

2 Compare the results of the access points.

Start by using these criteria, but be sure to add any others that are important to you, for example:

o Most clicks, which indicates the highest number of started self-service

flows.

o Most completed self-service flows.

o Most agent callback, chat, or email requests.

o Most positive feedback.

3 Use the results to set one or more access points for the production release.

Releasing the Visual IVR

When you are ready to release the Visual IVR into production, promote, release, and monitor the results.

1 Promote the new self-service feature.

2 Capture feedback and analyze reports.

3 Use the feedback that you obtain:

o Target specific customers.

o Refine your business processes, Web site design, and Visual IVR scripts.

o Train your employees to interact effectively with callers who are using a

visual flow.

Visual IVR Scripts

Preparing Your Inbound Campaigns

Preparing Your Inbound Campaigns

This section describes the required campaign configuration.

To set these options, see Creating IVR Schedule Rules in the Campaign Administrator's Guide.

Enabling the Visual Mode

To enable an inbound campaign, check Visual Mode in the IVR schedule of the campaign properties. Depending on your campaign configuration, your customers may be able to choose between voice or Visual IVR paths. When a campaign is configured to use voice and visual prompts, visual prompts take precedence over voice prompts as follows:

l If you enable Visual IVR, the HTML text entered in the Visual IVR Page tab of a

module that supports visual prompts overrides all other prompts.

l If Visual IVR scripts do not exist, standard prompts are rendered visually in HTML

unless the campaign contains only recorded prompts files, which cannot be rendered visually.

Enabling National and International Callbacks

To enable your agents to return calls associated with a Visual IVR, you must enable at least the first feature.

1 To enable the callback option in Visual IVR sessions, check Visual Mode in the

IVR schedule of the campaign properties.

By default, the Callback option is enabled. You may now return only in-country calls.

2 To return international calls associated with IVR and Visual IVR sessions, check

Allow collection and callback of international numbers in the Queue Callback Tab of the Skill Transfer module (see Queue Callback Tab).

Depending on your business, callers may request a callback to an international number. To reduce phone charges, this option enables you to select whether to

21 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 622

Visual IVR Scripts

Preparing Your Inbound Campaigns

include or exclude international phone numbers from callback options. If you do not enable this option, you cannot return international calls.

Securing Your Visual IVR Pages

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when a link or script is added to a page in a Web site where the user has been authenticated. Because the user is trusted, the attack is insidious. The element or page contains a link or script that, if clicked, redirects your customers away from your site. For more information about this subject, see Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet. For information about the supported browsers, see Five9 Visual IVR in the Technical Requirements Reference Guide.

The Five9 Web Page Security feature prevents malicious pages from being embedded in a frame in your Web site. By restricting access to your Web pages, you can prevent unauthorized commands, which protects your customers and your business.

Important

To prevent malicious framing of a Web page, you must use the X-Frame- Options HTTP header with the value appropriate for your business. The command is ignored if you place it in an http-equiv meta element of the page.

Example

Sarah is starting a Visual IVR session at your Web site. She enters required information in text fields. In another browser tab, Sarah opens a page at another Web site. She does not know that this page is harmful. On that page, she clicks a fake element, which sends a request to cancel the Visual IVR session. The session is canceled. Sarah cannot receive the service that she expected from your company.

In the IVR schedule properties, select an X-Frame-Options header option to allow the correct page to be displayed in a frame:

l DENY: Cannot be displayed even if the frame is located in the same domain as

the page. You cannot start a Visual IVR script with this value in the iframe. Use this value if you do not need to place a Visual IVR link in an iframe. This option provides the most security from attacks.

l SAME_ORIGIN: Can be displayed only if the frame is located in the same domain

as the page. This option is mostly for internal uses because customers cannot access internal Web pages.

Preparing Your Inbound Campaigns

Example

The HTTP header of http://shop.example.com/confirm.asp contains X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAME_ORIGIN. Any frame in the http://shop.example.com domain can be displayed.

l ALLOW_FROM: Can be displayed only if the frame is located in the domain that

you specify in the field.

Example

The HTTP header of http://shop.example.com/confirm.asp contains X-FRAME-OPTIONS: ALLOW_FROM https://partner.affiliate.com. The page may be framed only by pages in the https://partner.affiliate.com domain.

Using the Visual IVR URL

You can test and customize the link at the bottom of the DNIS tab of the campaign properties. This link enables you to create a Visual IVR session, which opens a Visual IVR flow in your browser. You can test the flow of any script associated with the campaign. The URL is generated specifically for each campaign. The link is in this format:

<base_url>/<domain_id>/campaigns/<campaign_id>/new_ivr_session base_url: http://api.five9.com/ivr/<Visual IVR API version> domain_id: ID of your domain campaing_id: ID of your campaign

Example

http://api.five9.com/ivr/1/12345/campaigns/123/new_ivr_session

Terminating the Visual IVR

At the end of the Visual IVR flow, you may add the CALLBACK_URL parameter if you want your customers to see a specific page. The optional parameter does not refer to callbacks or callback reminders but to any of the possible available methods to contact the customer, such as a specific Web page at your site, an email form, or a chat session.

Example

http://api.five9.com/ivr/1/12345/campaigns/123/new_ivr_session?__ CALLBACK_URL__=http://www.myEmailForm.com

Integrating a Visual IVR Script in Your Web Site

To use a Visual IVR script, you need to customize the script to start Visual IVR and a button or link to a Web page so that the customer can access the Visual IVR. Start by copying the code from these files:

IVRLaunch.js vivrContainer.html

Customizing the Script

Follow these steps to add the script to your Web site and to customize it.

1 Include the IVRLaunch.js script in your Web page by using a script tag.

<script src="/<PathToFile>/IVRLaunch.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

2 Customize the file with your domain, campaign, and messageError properties:

var IVRLaunch = {

host: "api.five9.com",

version: "ivr",

domain: "<My_Domain>",

campaign: "<My_VIVR_Campaign>",

layout: null,

messageError: "<div style='height: 49px; display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; font-weight: bold; font-size: 30px;'><Please call us at +1 888.888.8888></div>"

};

3 At the bottom of the file, locate vivrContainer.html in the method named

IVRLaunch.init().

4 The script uses vivrContainer.html to present the VIVR content to your

customers. You can modify the CSS as needed.

24 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 625

Visual IVR Scripts

Integrating a Visual IVR Script in Your Web Site

5 Add the path to the file in your Web site:

/** Load the Visual IVR container */

$.get("/<Path_To_File>/vivrContainer.html" + "?seconds=" +

(new Date()).getMilliseconds(),

function(data) {IVRLaunch.layout = data;}

);

Adding a Button or Link to a Web Page

Place a button or link on your Web site to check if Visual IVR is available and, if so, to start a session. The script looks for checkVIVR, which is case sensitive. For example, this button uses Bootstrap CSS classes:

<a id="checkVIVR" class="btn btn-large btn-primary">Contact Customer Support</a>

Customizing the Visual IVR Page

Follow these steps to customize the presentation of your Visual IVR page:

Note

You must be a developer to modify the CSS.

1 In VCC administrator application, open the campaign properties for the VIVR

campaign that you want to modify.

Choosing Modules

With Visual IVR flows, you can use most modules, and you need to understand the differences between voice and visual flows.

Available Modules This table contains the modules that can be used in Visual IVR scripts.

Customer Interaction1 General IVR Flow2

l Get Digits

l Case

l Input

l Contact Update

l Lookup Contact

l Foreign script

l Menu

l Hang up

l Play

l If/else

l Query

l Iterator

l System Info

l Set DNC

l Voice Input

l Set Variable

l Skill Transfer

l Update system info

1These modules contain a Page tab where you can add prompts that are rendered visually in HTML. 2These modules can be connected and branched, and obtain or update information.

Modules with Collapsible Prompts A few modules have an option named Collapsible that is used to concatenate all the prompts in the module whether they are played (voice) or displayed (Visual IVR).

When this option is enabled, callers see at once all the prompts in the same window. When this option is disabled, callers hear or see each prompt after performing the requested action.

You may add these prompts in the Prompts and Page tabs of these modules:

l Input

l Menu

l Play

l Voice Input

Modules that Accept Images Full-size and thumbnail images added to Visual IVR scripts can improve your branding or help to describe a service or product. You can add images to these modules:

l Get Digits

l Play

l Input

l Query

l Lookup Contact Record

l System Info

l Menu

l Voice Input

You may add image files to the Page tab by specifying a URL or by adding the images as variables. When using variables, you can add the image to any variable group, and the name of the variable is arbitrary. The value of the variable must be the valid URL of an image. However, you cannot add links to images.

Example

You may use this functional URL to test your variable in a Visual IVR script:

var = MyCav.str value = http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/unicode/ascii.png

Example

This menu enables the customer to see a preview of an event, which facilitates the customer’s decision. Each image is added to the Menu module.

Five9 Engagement Workflow

Five9 Engagement Workflow enables you to harness the power of either or all of the Five9 Rules Engine Module and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Query Module JSON responses for parsing, or SFDC Einstein Module capabilities to enhance your email interaction routing. More information about Five9 Engagement Workflow can be found in the Digital Engagement Administrator's Guide.

Using Five9 Engagement Workflow

Five9 Engagement Workflow begins with your IVR script. In the simplest form, you can enhance email routing with such things as: call attached variables, contact profile information, disparate database lookups, or SFDC Einstein engine functions.

You can augment your routing decisions further by using NLP to determine such things as customer sentiment and urgency. Beyond this, you can filter spam from your distributed email interactions while recommending a next best action for relevant email interactions by scouring the email body.

Configuring Engagement Workflow Templates

Five9 provides many templates to help with your IVR design. You can find these templates in the Five9 VCC Administrator application in the IVR Scripts > Service Scripts subfolder.

You can open example IVR scripts, as view only, or copy as a basis for your new script generation. Example IVR scripts are to be used for text (chat and email) interactions only.

40 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 641

Five9 Engagement Workflow

Configuring Engagement Workflow Templates

Your copy of an example template enables you to easily populate your specific contact center details, such as data lookups, queues, and, in this example, email routed by subject.

To further categorize your engagement workflow routing and reporting, you can assign a custom disposition to your hangup module for engagement workflow interactions. You must have, or create, matching disposition values in your VCC and Text Channel Administrator (SCC) applications. Depending on your Unified Dispositions setting, the rule engine will use either your VCC or SCC disposition for these interactions. This enables your IVR script to recognize and assign the custom disposition value in the hangup module. For more information about creating and assigning disposition values, see the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

You can find more detailed information about Five9 Engagement Workflow, NLP, Five9 Rules, Unified Dispositions, or SFDC Einstein in the Digital Engagement Administrator's Guide.

– Description: Your description is copied as a comment into generated scripts prepared for Web requests.

– Initial value: Whether to assign a default value to the variable. Variables that are not initialized are NULL (empty cells in the Variables tab). Empty strings have two double quotes.

String values can be entered as text or text surrounded by quotes. Internally surrounding quotation marks should be omitted, but the Variable tab shows all string values in the quotes. A variable of CURRENCY data type can be entered with or without the dollar ($) sign. DATE and TIME can be entered in an arbitrary format, which can be interpreted correctly.

o Basic String Functions:

– String Length – returns the number of characters in the input string

– String Left – return the characters of the specified length starting from the left most character of the string

– String Right – return the characters of the specified length starting from the rightmost character of the string

– External value: Can be used as the script's parameter. If a variable is marked External, its initial value can be set from the script schedule or from a calling script (foreign script). If the external values are specified at the script start time, the initial values in the table are not taken into consideration. The updated values of external variables are available in the calling script after exiting from the called script by passing reference parameters.

Implementing IVR Scripts

Adding Prompts

Module Description Agent/Voice Mail Transfer Module A termination module that allows you to

transfer calls to agents or to voicemail.

Conference Module Enables you to add other parties to a conference call.

Get Digits Module Enables you to route a call by using digits entered by the caller into a variable.

Input Module Analyzes spoken words or DTMF input.

Lookup Contact Record Module Enables you to retrieve information from the caller's contact record.

Menu Module Enables you to configure multiple exit branches based on caller input.

Play Module Enables you to play prompts or greetings anywhere in the script.

Query Module Enables you to exchange database information with an external source.

Skill Transfer Module Enables you to transfer calls to skill queues.

System Info Module Enables you to retrieve properties and statistics.

Voice Input Module Prompts the caller for information and saves the caller input.

Adding Prompts

In the Prompts tab, click Add to select a prompt to be played by this module. The list of prompts includes the default prompts and the prompts that you uploaded in the Prompts folder. You can define one or several prompts to be played. You can indicate the sequence of prompts and how many times they should be used. Each prompt can be interruptible.

l Interruptible – Stops playing the prompt as soon as the background operation is

completed, or the caller provides additional input.

l Exit the module in case of a prompt exception – indicates whether the IVR

should move to the next module if there is an error in retrieving or playing a prompt. TTS (enumerate) is a prompt element that opens a text-to-speech configuration window, with two additional variables: prompt and dtmf (if DTMF is enabled) available in Variable selection combo box. The Enumerate element is an automatically generated

description of the available choices. It specifies a template that is applied to each choice in the order they appear in the menu. A default template is shown initially when the Enumerate is added, but the user can change the text. If DTMF is enabled, the prompt generator prepares an appropriate prompt.

Selecting Dispositions

Dispositions are used only when calls are terminated or disconnected in these modules:

l Extension Transfer Module

l Hangup Module

l Third Party Transfer Module

l Voicemail Transfer Module The Dispositions tab contains a default disposition that you can change to any system or custom disposition:

l Agent dispositions are used when a call is transferred to an agent.

l IVR dispositions are automatically used by the system when a call is

disconnected during the IVR script. Any disposition, such as Send Email Notification and Add to DNC, can be assigned by the system. IVR dispositions enable you to see in reports where the caller was disconnected from the IVR script.

Using Recorded Files

Using Recorded Files

Several IVR modules can collect audio information:

l Conference Module

l Input Module

l Menu Module

l Third Party Transfer Module

l Voice Input Module The files can be processed by these modules:

l Agent/Voice Mail Transfer Module

l Hangup Module

l Skill Transfer Module

l Voicemail Transfer Module These modules have the Action for Recorded Files menu. You can select these actions for the recorded files:

l Keep as Recording - Associates the recording with the call and makes it available

for reporting.

l Send to Agent - Routes the recording to the agent that receives the call, as

voicemail (not Hangup Module).

l Delete - Deletes the recording. There are two purposes for using audio files:

l Call post-processing - When the information cannot be gathered using DTMF or

speech recognition (name, street address, etc.), it can be recorded using the Voice Input module and delivered to the agents. The recordings are transformed into voicemail with an ability to be delivered as skill voicemail.

l Regular recordings - The callers input is saved as audio files. Agents will not have

an access to the files in this case. This option can be used if you do not need to convert the recorded information into the written form. For example, regular recordings can be useful for surveys. The recordings can also help administrators to debug their IVR scripts and fine-tune the choices configured in a Menu module. If the Send to Agent option is selected in the IVR script, the recording is available to the agent who can access the recordings in the Voicemail tab. Recordings are labeled with the incoming skill queue.

Importing Scripts

Assuming the IVR Script is set to Keep as Recording mode, recorded audio files gathered via IVR modules are transformed into recordings (not voicemail). They are available via Reports and saved on FTP server with a unique file name based on the campaign's applicable recording file naming convention, appended with _<Recording ID>. The Voice Input module name is a reference of the audio file that holds the recording.

Importing Scripts

IVR scripts are located in the navigation pane. You can import a script in an existing script, or in a new script. Double-click the script.

You can use the following elements:

l Modules toolbar: IVR module icons that you drag to the work area. Hover over

the icon to view the module name.

l Work area: re-sizable window where you construct your script with modules and

connectors.

l Bottom pane: post-disconnect handling. For example, with the Query Module

and Web2Campaign, abandoned callers can be added to an outbound campaign for a callback. The fields of a contact record can be updated with Abandoned=TRUE, which would identify records to include in an outbound campaign (functions in reporting can automatically add these contacts to a list). Each module contains an icon, label (can be hidden), and connector ports. Module relationships and order are presented as arrows which connect the icons. Each module has properties.

IVR modules are connected to each other by connector ports as shown in the figure below. Several modules can follow one module (IncomingCall module). Some modules have two output ports (If/Else and Answering Machine modules). Some modules have one output for each branch (Case module). Termination modules have no output ports.

The module execution can cause errors and exceptional situations. For example, a request for external data may not be answered for a specified timeout, a contact record may not be found in the database, etc. For handling these exceptional conditions, there is an additional error exit from the modules. Most of the modules have an exception port.

For example, the Voicemail Transfer module can have these exceptions: Transfer to voicemail cannot be executed and Wrong agent or skill information in Variable (Agent/Skill can not be found). The Hang Up module does not have any exceptions.

Using the exception port is optional. If no action is specified for the exception, it is ignored and the main exit is used.

ERR_CODE variable contains the value from the previous module. The error codes can differ for each IVR module. Error codes can be found in topics describing a particular IVR module.

You can link one branch into another branch in order not to repeat the same modules for each branch.

You can form loops by connecting a module to a previous module. A loop with exit by condition (like WHILE) looks like:

A loop, such as FOR, with a predefined number of iterations requires that you define a loop counter variable and use an expression in a Set Variable module to increase or decrease it:

o Voice: Voice character available to speak the voice prompts. The voice is

female.

l Data Access: Default parameters used to access the data in the Query module.

o URL: Address of the data.

o Method: GET and POST methods.

o Fetch timeout: Time-out in seconds for the request.

o Script Type: Type of script for Web server: ASP, PERL, PHP.

o Script path: Location of the script on your system.

o Visual IVR Default Timeout (min): Time-out in minutes for the visual IVR to

appear.

Important: Five9 recommends setting this to the 30-minute maximum for IVR scripts used to transfer chat interactions to chatbot.

o Reset Error Code to 0: Resets __error_code__ value to 0 between

interconnected modules.

– Enabled: The __error_code__ value is set in each executed module. Default value for new scripts. – Disabled: The __error_code__ value carried throughout execution.

Example

Consider three subsequent IVR modules: Module1 and Module2 lead to an IfElse module. The ifElse module starts with an __ error_code__ value of 0. If an exception happens in Module1, the __error_code__ of Module1 is set to a corresponding non- zero value. Module2 is completed normally. In this example, the IfElse goes to the TRUE branch as soon as the Module2 is executed without problems. Otherwise, the IfElse module returns FALSE.

l Use IVR time zone in variables assignment: Select this option to use the IVR Set

Variable Module to assign IVR _TIME_ variable to Contact.Time. Conversely, you can use this option with the Contact Update Module to synchronize the contact variables with the contact record.

Variables A variable is a field to use in your IVR script to store and manipulate temporary data in the IVR. Variables have a name, type, and value. Variables are essential parts of a script. All script modules can access defined variables. Store call-attached data in the

73 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

form of variables to use in latter parts of the IVR script or integrate into the text-to- speech messages. You can assign customer data to variables.

Use the predefined variables or create your own to store temporary data. You manage variables in the Variables window opened in the IVR Script properties window (the Script menu). See also, Managing Variables.

While creating TTS prompts, enter text phrases and insert contact, call, or system variables in the text. See also, Adding Prompts.

Use variables to hold values to keep for later processing during script execution. When you request the external Web server for information, you will probably want to use the result of that request somewhere else in your script.

Variables include these types:

l User Variables: Variables have local scope and are accessible only by the script

where they were defined. The BUFFER variable is automatically created in each script. Create script variables with names that include alphanumeric characters and underscores, starting from a letter or underscore.

l Call Variables: Metadata about a call: Call.ANI, Call.DNIS, Call.bill_time,

Call.campaign_id, Call.campaign_name, Call.comments, Call.disposition_id, Call.disposition_name, Call.end_timestamp, Call.handle_time, Call.hold_time, Call.length, Call.number, Call.park_time, Call.queue_time, Call.session_id, Call.skill_id, Call.skill_name, Call.start_timestamp, Call.type, Call.type_name, and Call.wrapup_time.

l Call Attached Variables (CAVs): Key-value pairs specific to calls available until

the agent assigns a disposition. These variables are accessible from the IVR by the agent who receives the call or transfer, by agents who are consulted or added to a conference call, and from the IVR again when a call transfers back to the IVR. Call variables are global variables that are often permanent (stored for reporting purposes); whereas IVR variables are temporary local variables used within an IVR script.

l System Variables:

o CRM_ID: Internal ID of the CRM record currently selected in the IVR.

o DATE: System date set in the time zone of the campaign that contains the

IVR.

o DAY: Numeric value that represents the day of the week set in the time

zone of the campaign that contains the IVR.

Values. The following are ways of assigning values to a variable while using IVR:

l By specifying initial value in variables definition screen. See Managing Variables.

l From scheduler (for upper level script). See Managing IVR Script Schedules for

Autodial and Inbound Campaigns in the Campaign Administrator's Guide.

l From calling procedure (if the script is invoked by other script). See Foreign

Script Module.

l By using the Set Variable IVR module.

l As user input.

l Through internal database dip (for contact variables).

l In result of request to Web server. Variables of any type not initialized by any of these options have a special NULL value. It is possible to assign NULL value to a variable or check if a variable is NULL using the If/Else module. NULL values aren't defined for logical expressions and results in exceptions in corresponding modules (If/Else and Case modules).

File URL allows you to use a remote file that can have over a million entries and be retrieved using the URL.

The entries file (encoded as UTF-8) consists of alphanumeric strings to recognize, one entry per line. Don't use quotation marks. Constraints are uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters (recognition considers cases the same). Non-alphanumeric characters, such as dashes or spaces, are ignored. The entries can't contain special characters: those with accents (for example, è) or tildes (~). By default, each constraint has no spaces between the elements.

You can add a header with a list of directives to the top of the file. The header must consist of lines beginning with a double colon (::) followed by a directive (no spaces).

Directive Description

::DELIMITED This file uses spaces between each element in each con- straint. Spaces are ignored. Use this directive when two characters represent a single alphabet character (for example, the Spanish letter ch).

::WEIGHTED max Constraints have a weight value following the entry to indicate the probability of hearing that constraint (for example, 12a4 and 1284 sound similar in English). You can assign a higher weight to the entry that would more likely be spoken.

max is the maximum weight a constraint can have. When using WEIGHTED, you must end every constraint with <space><real_number> where, real_number is the weight to assign the constraint.

Note:

l You must include the space even if not specifying

::DELIMITED.

l Non-numeric weights cause the entries file to fail

to load. Any specified value greater than max defaults to max and a warning displays.

::LENGTH len All constraints in the file are the same length, len characters long. This directive improves recognition accuracy.

::NUM n This file contains n constraints (or fewer). This can speed the loading of the entries file as only the specified number of constraints will load.

Note: Dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) is not recognized by alphanum.

IVR Modules

Each IVR module controls an aspect of a call. An IVR script is a set of linked modules. When the system receives a call, the IVR script routes the caller from one module to the next until the caller is transferred to an agent, voicemail, or another destination. Specific modules are used at the start, middle, or end of a script. For a list of error messages that you can see with each module, see Error Messages.

Agent/Voice Mail Transfer Module

The Agent/Voice Mail Transfer module is a termination module that enables you to transfer calls to agents or to voicemail.

If Agent Transfer is selected then the interaction is routed to the specified agent.

Note

You can also route by agent extension id or by variable. Additionally, Five9 supports the module’s transfer to any available agent option.

Agent Assignment for Text Channel Interactions

The following rules apply to agent assignment for text channel interactions.

97 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 698

Modules

Agent/Voice Mail Transfer Module

Transferring to a Specific Agent An interaction is assigned to an agent when the agent identified by the agent transfer module is:

l Logged in

l Ready

l Available

l Not at interaction capacity

Transferring to Any Available Agent To transfer to any available agent, select to enable the Transfer to any available agent option. The text interaction is routed to any available agent, chosen using longest-wait algorithm. If there are no available agents then the interaction is routed to the default skill for the profile. Because you may not use call variables that contain sensitive information in this field, these variables do not appear in the menu even if they exist in the Call Variables folder of the VCC.

For text channel interactions, Five9 stops processing the IVR script after using an agent transfer module regardless of agent availability.

If a user abandons the chat session while waiting for an agent to accept that interaction, it is not assigned to the agent selected by the agent transfer module.

The Text Channels Administrator Console setting Ignore Agent Interaction Limits for Transfers and Conferences does not apply to interaction limits for this module. The text interaction is assigned to an agent only if the current interaction capacity is less than the maximum allowable capacity, regardless of this option setting in SCC.

Agent/Voicemail Assignment for Voice Interactions

This module enables voice interaction transfer to agent, skill, or voicemail options to exit an IVR script.

Modules

Answering Machine Module

Important: If you plan on requiring this functionality, the only supported location is the first module after the Incoming Call Module. Using the Answering Machine Module later in the flow is not supported and may trigger error 1400.

The parts of the module are used as follows:

l Answering machine: Module branch used when the system determines that the

call is answered by the recording of an answering machine. In this case, the script proceeds to the next module, which is usually a Play module that contains a recorded message followed by a Hang Up module.

l Live person: Module branch used when the system determines that the call is

answered by a person. In this case, the script proceeds with the rest of the script. If you omit this module, the beginning of the recorded message of the following Play module is cut off while the answering machine greeting is played.

l Wait For Answering Machine Tone: Whether to wait for a tone. This option is

typically used when the answering machine tone may not be immediately detected.

o Enabled: Wait for a tone

o Disabled: Do not wait for a tone.

Important: When this option is enabled, the system waits the configured maximum wait time, anticipating the tone at the end of the voicemail greeting. After the configured maximum wait time, the system proceeds to the next module, typically a Play module with a recorded message. In a case where the answering machine message exceeds the configured maximum wait time, the recorded message may be

abbreviated or not heard at all, or the call may be disconnected while the voicemail greeting is still playing.

l Maximum Wait Time: Applies if you enabled the answering machine tone

option. Number of seconds to wait for the answering machine greeting. The default is 20 seconds.

Case Module

The Case module enables you to create as many branches as you need to handle all the possible user input or the information contained in a variable. Each possible case must have its own branch.

Example

A Get Digits module contains this prompt: For Sales, press 1. For Support, press 2. The Get Digits module is followed by the Case module that contains the BUFFER variable with the values 1, which is leads to the Sales branch, and 2, which is leads to the Support branch. In this case, the Case module has three branches: Sales, Support, and No Match to handle all other caller input.

The Conference module enables callers to add other parties to a conference call. Callers entering this module are prompted to enter a phone number to invite a participant. The module dials the number and connects the second party to the first caller. Participants can leave the conference at any time. Except while adding a conference participant, the first caller can leave the conference or hang up. At that time, the conference is discontinued, and all participants are disconnected.

If your domain is not enabled for the E.164 format for international phone numbers, agents must enter 10 digits to conform to the North American Numbering Plan. If your domain is enabled for the E.164 format, agents must enter phone numbers for all calls according to your configuration: in your national format or up to 15 digits, starting with the plus (+) sign and the country code. If you do not specify a format, the VCC uses the E.164 format for all numbers. For more information, see the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Extension Transfer Module

The Extension Transfer module transfers a call to an agent after the caller enters a four- digit extension. The module plays the prompt Please enter the extension of the party you wish to reach. If a user account matches the extension number, the call is transferred to the agent or to voicemail if the agent is not available.

This module combines the Get Digits and two Play modules with standard files played during the module execution (input prompt) and on wrong user input.

Because this module has two connector ports, it can be used as a termination module and as a child module. If a Play module precedes the Extension Transfer module, the prompt in the Extension Transfer module is not played, which enables you to add customized instructions for entering an extension in the Play module.

This module handles invalid entries and extensions as follows:

l When the Extension Transfer is used as a termination module, this module plays

the message Extension xxxx is not available followed by Please enter the extension of the party you wish to reach. The caller may enter an extension up to three times. The call is disconnected after three invalid entries.

l When the Extension Transfer is followed by another module, the IVR script

proceeds to the following module.

Important

The Five9 Rules Engine evaluates messages up to 20,000 characters in length. Messages exceeding this limit may be distributed to the default skill associated with the assigned profile.

o Response transformation field: Add regular expressions enclosed in

parentheses. Regular expressions are automatically added to the RegExp Group field.

Example

This expression matches the first instance of one or more characters. <State>(.^?)</State>-<City>(.+?)</City>(.+?)

o Map the expressions to IVR variables in the RegExp Group field. Assign the

result to a variable. In this case, the result is assigned to the City variable.

Enable option to pass contact variables to the called script.

l Returned Variables: Contains response attributes listed as key-value pairs.

Foreign Script Module

Foreign Script Module

The Foreign Script module enables you to use an IVR script that contains at least one variable in the current script. The variables of the foreign script enable you to set the variables in the current script so that variables are returned in your current script. For example, you can use the same search script in multiple scripts. You can use the Foreign Script module after any module with defined variables.

Because you may not use call variables that contain sensitive information in this field, these variables do not appear in the menu even if they exist in the Call Variables folder of the VCC.

Chat Customer Disconnect or Timeout

A chat user (customer/contact) disconnect or timeout may cause the IVR to fail at the next transfer, as the chat interaction is already disconnected. To enable post-terminate options, such as disposition, email transcript, survey, and so on, configure a hangup module as the next step after a disconnect. See chatbot_example script below.

Using the Chatbot Script

The supplied script assumes that you have a basic working knowledge of the Five9 IVR Builder. In this example, the contact information is retrieved from your system, if available, and sent to your chatbot. Any information returned from your chatbot is stored in Five9 as a chat transcript, and the interaction is routed by using standard Five9 IVR functionality.

You can rename the module and assign specific parameters in the General tab. You use the Authorization tab to assign a pre-defined basic authorization profile for transfer to Five9 IVA-Digital for chatbot tasks. For tasks not using Five9IVA-Digital, you may also

Text-to-Speech Say As Options

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) Say as options enable you to play words or phrases to your customers in a contextual format. In certain instances, the text should be split apart if it contains words that require special treatment. For example, phone numbers that are part of a larger phrase should be split out into a separate text element so that you can apply the Say as telephone rule to it. The descriptions and data types are detailed below.

Query Module

Query Module

The Query module enables you to obtain database information from an external Web site, access third-party Web services, or integrate an external source of contact data. You can send GET or POST requests in which input parameters are appended to the request URL or XML Web service POST requests.

When using Visual IVR scripts, you may also add images to pages and menus to enhance your brand or to describe a product or service. However, you cannot add links to images. For more information, see Page Tab.

Types of Database Properties Use Case

This chapter is intended for developers who understand these technologies and protocols:

l Client-server architecture

l XML and Web Services

l HTTP protocol

l Web programming languages, such as ASP, Perl, PHP, Java, or Ruby

Types of Database

The flow of information differs depending on the type of database that you access:

l If the database supports Web APIs, you can access information directly with the

Query module.

l If the database, such as MySQL™, does not support Web APIs, you can use a

Web server as a proxy for the database:

a Send an HTTP request from the Query module to your Web server. To

create a secure connection, use basic access authentication. b Add a script to your Web server. The script returns the data in the format

specified in the script.

l Use one Set DNC module for each phone number (maximum three modules).

l Create an IVR script that contains post-processing steps, such as a disposition

that adds all the contact’s numbers to the list.

Use this module as follows:

l If an inbound campaign receives return calls from an outbound campaign, give

the caller the option to be placed on your Do Not Call list so that your agents do not need to spend time to process DNC requests.

l For autodial campaigns, provide to contacts an option to opt out of future

campaigns. The Variable menu contains a list of all your variables. Select the string variable that contains the phone number to add to your DNC list.

Set Variable Module

The Set Variable module enables you to assign specific values to variables. Typically, use this module to test the value of one variable in the If/Else or Case modules. You assign a value to another variable with the Set Variable module for a subsequent Web request or call routing decision.

Variables are subject to these size limitations: 1M characters for script variables and 2040 characters for call/reporting variables. For an example of the Set Variable module following the If/Else module, see Simple Campaign Script for Post-Call Surveys.

Because you may not use call variables that contain sensitive information in this field, these variables do not appear in the menu even if they exist in the Call Variables folder of the VCC.

Using the KVLIST Data Type Functions

To pass sets of data fields to and from IVR, use collections of values with functions for accessing, adding, and deleting elements with keys. You can iterate all elements in the collection and convert the collections to strings to send/receive them to/from external systems. To do so, use the KVLIST data type, which uses collections of string key-value pairs instead of elementary data.

Defining a KVLIST Collection Using KVLIST Variable Functions

234 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 835

Modules

Set Variable Module

Defining a KVLIST Collection You can introduce a KVLIST collection by defining a variable with KVLIST data type selected. For information on adding or creating variables, see Adding Variables.

These variables may have an initial value defined as a JSON-formatted string with a collection of key-value pairs, where both keys and values are strings.

Example

A variable named Person contains key-value pairs that describe a person:

Person = {"last_name": "Jones", "first_name": "Betty", "age": "31", "phone": "650.321.4800"}

"last_name", "first_name", "age", and "phone" are keys for values "Jones", "Betty", "31", and "650.321.4800".

KVLIST variables without a default value are considered empty variables.

Assignment {} is an empty KVLIST but a non-empty variable.

Using KVLIST Variable Functions Specific functions are used in conjunction with the KVLIST data type to return a JSON string of key-value pairs enabling you to store multiple data elements in a single IVR

variable. Benefits of using the KVLIST data type include:

IVR can dynamically expand or contract the volume of variables, or data elements, used rather than manually storing every possible variable value.

JSON response to IVR Query module requests can be more easily parsed than standard elementary pairing with string pattern matches.

Specific functions (see function descriptions below) with a KVLIST data type return a JSON string of key-value pairs, enabling you to store multiple data elements in a single IVR variable:

l To GET the value of a key.

l To GET a key according to index, or position.

l To PUT, or write, a new key-value pair.

l To REMOVE a KV pair from a KVLIST.

l To TRANSFORM a KVLIST to a regular string.

l To return the SIZE of a KVLIST as an integer.

o Loop: Whether to play the recording multiple times.

o Timeout: Interval from 0 to 3600 seconds between the end of the

previous recording and the beginning of the current recording. If the time- out is 0, the current recording is played without pause after the previous recording. If the Loop option is enabled, the time-out also determines the time-out from the end of the previous loop iteration. The default time-out is 1. The time-out for the first enabled recording is calculated from the moment that the call enters this module.

o Voice File to Play: Possible recording options to play:

– Estimated Wait Time (default prompt) – System prompt – Custom prompt in your Prompts folder

Estimated Wait Time Estimated Wait Time (EWT) uses a sophisticated algorithm to predict the wait time for callers within the skill and uses these two consistent metrics:

l EWT = The position of the caller in the queue divided by the Skill Answer Rate.

EWT data is pulled from the last 15-minute interval. If the calculated EWT value is less than 60 seconds, the final value is always 60 seconds (this approach applies whether one or more skills are included in the Skill Transfer module). This default calculation applies to queues with >30 calls in the last 15 minutes.

More granular logic is used for <15 or 15–30 calls entering the queue in the last 15 minutes.

o Calculations for <15 calls in the last 15 minutes:

– If calls are immediately assigned to an agent: EWT = 60 seconds

– If the call is queued and there are no available agents: EWT = current Answer Rate (no less than 60 seconds) or 10 minutes (default) if no calls were in the queue in the last 15 minutes

– If call is queued and agents are available: EWT = current Answer Rate minus the caller's elapsed Wait Time or 5 minutes minus the caller's elapsed Wait Time if no calls were in the queue in the last 15 minutes

o Calculations for 15–30 calls entering the queue in the last 15

minutes: the default EWT calculation minus the number of seconds since the last call entered the queue

l Skill Answer Rate: The average number of calls answered per minute, using the

statistical data collected in the last 15-minute period.

Example

During the last 15-minute period, there were 45 calls answered for a specific skill. The Skill Answer Rate for that skill is 3 per minute: 45 ÷ 15 = 3

For the 6thcaller waiting in queue, EWT is 2 minutes: 6 ÷ 3 = 2

For the 9th caller waiting in queue, EWT is 3 minutes: 9 ÷ 3 = 3

Priority Tab

Amount, from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest), that the call’s base priority is increased or decreased. You can use a specific number, or a contact, system, or call variable. Calls with higher priority are answered first. The base priority is either 10, the default, or the value that is set as Initial Call Priority in the associated campaign profile. See the Five9 Campaign Administrator’s guide for more information. The resulting value must still be within the range one to 100.

If your script has multiple IVR modules that route the calls to the same queue, the behavior is as in the following example.

l If both modules have the default priority settings, calls are prioritized by the wait

time in the skill transfer module that they are in. So calls that are already waiting in SkillTransferA are routed to Skill W before a call that is just entering SkillTransferB.

l If SkillTransferB has a higher Priority setting, all calls in SkillTransferB are routed

to Skill W before any calls from SkillTransfer A are sent there. Example You have SkillTransferA and SkillTransferB, both routing calls to Skill W.

Note

The Skill Transfer module has a default Priority setting of Increase By: 10. So if the campaign has no associated campaign profile and you do not alter the mod- ule’s default setting, the call has a priority of 20.

Example

You have multiple IVR branches for the same agents. You want calls from one branch to be answered first. In this case, assign a higher priority to that branch.

.

Note

The priority of text items routed to agents who can manually select text interactions is the same as that for voice interactions. All interactions are created with default priority 50, which can be changed by Engagement Workflow. Filtering works as expected when items in the view contain inte...ractions that were processed with Engagement Workflow and others that did not.

Example

You can use this module to determine the number of agents logged in to a particular queue. For a queue that is normally staffed, the absence of logged-in agents may indicate a network failure or an emergency evacuation of your contact center. In this instance, you can play an emergency prompt to your callers to explain the absence of agents. See Defining Search Conditions for configuration details.

When using Visual IVR scripts, you can add images to pages and menus to enhance your brand or to describe a product or service; however, you cannot add links to images. For more information, see Page Tab.

After callers are prompted for information, the Voice Input module saves the speech as a recording. The recording stops when one of these conditions is met:

l The duration of the final silence is exceeded.

l A DTMF key is pressed.

l The maximum recording time is exceeded.

l The caller hangs up. If configured accordingly, the module can play the recording to callers for confirmation, with the option to re-record the message if necessary. The Skill Transfer and Agent/Voice Mail Transfer modules have a property that controls how the recorded files are presented and stored. You can set the Action for Recorded Files option (General tab):

l Keep as Recording: an inbound campaign can collect callers' address

information. The recorded file becomes available in reporting.

l Send to Agent: callers can be transferred to an agent with the Skill Transfer

Module. The recorded file becomes available in the agent desktop and in reporting.

– Termination Digit: Choose the number the caller presses to pass the call to the next IVR module.

– Queue Callback Digit: Choose the number the caller presses to receive a callback when their position in the queue arrives.

o Transfer to Agent defines the call routing for the agent's transfer process:

– Distribution algorithm specifies the way the ACD selects an agent to receive a call. The configured distribution algorithms are available from the drop-down list. Select an algorithm that meets the requirements of your enterprise:

– Longest Wait - All Calls: The ACD selects the agent with the longest wait (idle) time since their last call, of any call type.

– Longest Wait - Non-Manual: The ACD selects the agent with the longest wait (idle) time excluding manual calls.

– Round Robin: The ACD selects an agent from the list of logged-in agents who qualify for the queue. The list is initially sorted based on the longest wait (idle) time for all calls. When agents initially make themselves ready for the queue, they are added to the bottom of the list. The first queued call goes to the agent on top of the list. When an agent receives a call, the agent is removed from the list, until all agents are removed. For queued calls, when the only available agents are those already removed from the list, the calls are still routed to those agents.

– Min Calls Handled: The ACD prioritizes agents who have handled fewer calls than the other agents working in the queue, based on statistics. The number of calls is calculated from the agent's last login (that is, the current session), and then assessed for the selected time range (see the Time Frame option below).

Note: The time range counter for Min Calls Handled and Min Handle Time begins at agent login and resets to zero (0) at the interval set in the Time Frame option in the Skill Transfer Module.

298 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

IVR Examples

Creating an IVR Script

– Min Handle Time: The ACD prioritizes agents with the lowest total handle time compared to the other agents working in the queue, based on statistics. The total handle time is calculated from the agent's last login (that is, the current session), and then assessed for the selected time range (see the Time Frame option below).

– Time Frame: Time range for the Min Calls Handled or Min Handle Time distribution algorithms.

– Max Ring Time (secs): The maximum time for the agent to answer a call. The option allows you to set timeout in seconds.

– Pause Before Transfer (secs): Creates a delay before sending the call to the agent. When the agent is selected for a new call, the system waits the set amount of time before sending the call to the agent. When there are queued calls, this option gives agents a short pause before receiving the next call.

In our example, configure one Skill Transfer module to use the Sales skill group and the second to use the Support skill group. In the Skills window, add the skill groups that receive the calls and define the sequence to use to choose the skill group for transferring the call. The upper group receives the call first if there are agents available. Otherwise, the call transfers to the next skill group in the list with available agents.

8 Select the Priority tab.

Use priority management when you use one skill group in different script branches and the call from one branch to initially be accepted by available agents. You can modify the call priority. Priority means how fast the call transfers to agents from the queue. By default, Basic mode campaign calls begin with a call priority of 10 and Advanced mode calls have priority of 60. The priority range is from 0 to 100. You can increase priority to make the call transfer to the agent faster or decrease it to leave the call in queue for more time. For more information about campaign modes, see the Campaign Administrator's Guide.

Configuring the Support Branch For the Support branch, add the Skill Transfer module and link it to the Support branch. Configure the Skill Transfer module of the Support branch to route the call to the appropriate skill group.

Configuring the No Match Branch Now that we have the flow of the script, we need to configure the script to handle wrong input from the caller. For this we use the No Match branch of the Case module.

In our example, if caller makes an invalid entry (a number other than 1 or 2), they can repeat the input. After five consecutive invalid entries, the call is disconnected. If the caller's entry is invalid, we repeat the voice message instructions and have the caller try again. To trace the number of invalid entries, create the variable loop_var in the Variables tab to contain the number of allowed wrong entries (by default, Initial Value is 5).

## Page 910

IVR Examples

Creating an IVR Loop

There are other methods for creating loops. This is just one example. Another option is to set the loop variable to zero, then use If/Else to compare for the maximum number of loops and use SetVariable to add to, rather than subtract from, the loop variable. You can also insert a Play module inside the loop to inform the caller that they made an invalid entry.

Defining a Variable Adding and Configuring the Get Digits Module Adding and Configuring the Case Module Adding and Configuring the If/Else Module Adding and Configuring the Set Variable Module Linking the Modules

Defining a Variable

The first step in creating a loop is to define a variable. Set the initial value of the variable to the number of times you want to loop. For each loop we subtract one from this number. If the variable reaches zero, the loop will end.

Creating an IVR Loop

1 In the Visual IVR Script designer, select Variables from the Script menu.

2 Click Add.

3 Enter a name for the variable - in our case the name is loop_var.

4 Select INTEGER as the Type (an integer is any whole number, positive or

negative). Since we will be doing a calculation on this variable, subtracting 1 for each loop, it must be integer or numeric rather than a string.

5 In the Initial Value box, enter the maximum number of times you want to loop:

2.

6 Click OK to save the variable.

7 Click OK in the Variables window.

Adding and Configuring the Get Digits Module

Configure the Get Digits module to accept an entry from the caller. In our example, we accept a single digit (either 1 or 2) so we set the Maximum Number of Digits to 1.

IVR Examples

Creating an IVR Loop

We are using the default BUFFER system variable. The caller’s input is stored in this variable.

Adding and Configuring the Case Module

Configure the Case module with branches based on the caller’s input. We are comparing the value stored in the BUFFER system variable which was set by the caller’s input in the Get Digits module. Our loop will be used for the No Match branch.

For looping we use the combination of the If/Else module and the Set Variable module to determine how many times a caller has cycled through the loop. Set Variable decreases the loop variable by 1 each time through the loop. If/Else checks the value of the loop variable to determine if the caller has looped the maximum number of time.

312 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 913

IVR Examples

Creating an IVR Loop

Adding and Configuring the If/Else Module

If a caller makes an invalid entry or no entry at all, the IVR use the No Match branch. The first module in the No Match branch is used to check the value of the loop variable. We use the If/Else module to do the comparison.

If the value is equal to zero, we use the If branch. If it is greater than zero we use the Else branch. The Else branch is the loop. Since the initial value of the loop variable is 2 the first time through, the If/Else module uses the Else branch.

1 In the If/Else module click Add to add a new comparison.

2 In the Variable list select the loop variable you created (loop_var in this case).

3 In the Comparison Type list, select Equals.

4 In the Constant box enter 0 (zero).

Incoming Call Transfer to Studio IVA

Incoming Call Transfer to Studio IVA

This example identifies some basic interaction and data transfer using the Five9 Studio IVA solution. Your particular IVR script will involve more modules than discussed here. The focus of this example is three specific modules:

l Set Variable module to collect data to pass to Studio.

l Third-party Transfer module to transfer the interaction and collected data to

Studio.

l Set Variable module to pass return data to VCC, such as customer journey

details and interaction information.

Preparing Your Script Variables

You define and modify custom variables using Script Variables. The following variables support the modules identified in this example.

348 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 949

IVR Examples

Incoming Call Transfer to Studio IVA

1 FromStudio: This variables stores the return data following the IVA interaction.

This data is defined in the Return From IVA, or second Set Variable module used in this example.

2 StudioNumber: This variable translates the 12-digit Studio number for use in

Studio agent contact.

3 ToStudio: Data gathered in your IVR script to send to the IVA with the

interaction.

Collecting Data for IVA (to Studio)

The interaction heading toward Five9 IVA comes from the Five9 Engagement Workflow embedded in your campaign IVR script. Once the interaction is introduced to this campaign, the first Set Variable Module captures and stores information from Five9 to send with the interaction, such as DNIS. This module example explains capturing that DNIS information and lists additional, commonly used variables.

IVR Examples

Incoming Call Transfer to Studio IVA

1 Drag a Set Variable module into your IVR script canvas and double-click the

module to edit the properties.

2 The Assignment window opens. Click Add to create a new variable.

3 In the Variable dropdown menu, select _BUFFER_. You can select from the script

variables created in Preparing Your Script Variables.

4 Select the Function radio button for Assigned Value and select PUT(KVLIST,

STRING, STRING) from the Function dropdown. Function arguments are as follows:

a Argument #1: Variable - ToStudio

This calls the ToStudio script variable to store the Five9 DNIS and send it to Studio.

b Argument #2: Constant - X-five9dnis <insert your variable name here>

Important: Variable names exactly match those in Studio. This example is not using a required variable name. Use all lowercase characters for variable names because the data that returns in the IVA interaction is always lowercase and the names must match

c Argument #3: Variable - Call.DNIS

Important: You must select Return After 3rd Party to retrieve the interaction and select Send Data to 3rd Party and Return Data From 3rd Party to exchange variable information.

Data Return (From Studio)

The interaction remains in Studio until it is resolved or passed to a live agent. You can define interaction data to return in your Studio Header Node. Interaction information is captured from SIP headers as XSIP variables. The second Set Variable module identifies the return information from Studio. This example shows retrieving the customer journey information.

Creating an Opt-Out IVR Script

Connect the output of this module to the input of the main menu options Case module (see Case Module).

Creating an Opt-Out IVR Script

This example creates a IVR script that allows call recipients to opt out of telemarketing calls. It only applies to outbound campaigns.

FCC regulations require that all call recipients can add their dialed phone number to the Do Not Call list (DNC) for all abandoned calls during a recorded telemarketing message. When a person answers the phone, a call is considered abandoned or dropped if an agent is not available within 2 seconds of the completed greeting.

Note: The abandon rate 2-second rule calculation option allows you to use a queue time of 2 seconds or higher to identify outbound calls as abandoned. The Outbound Campaign Abandon Rate % 2 Seconds Rule standard report shows these values.

According to FCC guideline FCC 03-153, the message played must provide this information:

l Caller: business, Entity, or individual on whose behalf the call is made.

l Purpose: Telemarketing

l Phone number: To enable call recipients to place their number on the DNC list.

Understanding Digital Channels

Agents who are assigned digital channel skills can interact with customers through email, chat, and social media channels. To configure and enable digital channel features, you use the VCC Administrator application and the Digital Engagement Administrator’s Console.

Before configuring digital channels, ensure that Five9 has enabled these features in your VCC domain.

Character Limits for Domain Components

Always modify campaigns, skill groups, and users only in the VCC Administrator’s Application. Never do so in the Digital Engagement Console because changes in the console are overwritten when changes are made in the VCC.

In the Digital Engagement Administrator’s Console, modify the components that are not synchronized from the VCC to the digital engagement channel server.

Character Limits for Domain Components

If you use digital engagement channels or plan to do so in the future, you must adhere to character limitations when assigning names to campaign components. Otherwise, the digital engagement server does not communicate with the VCC server.

Priority of Text Interactions

The Automatic Interaction Distributor (AID) routes incoming text interactions to available agents based on the priority assigned to each interaction. Priorities of HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW are determined by business rules, language used in the text of the interaction, and waiting time in the media queue.

Note

Voice interactions are always prioritized and distributed before chat interactions. When multiple voice and chat interactions are in queue, the chats will not be distributed to ready agents for voice and text until all voice interactions in that queue are engaged.

Agent skill priority can only be set for calls and doesn't affect how chats will be distributed. Even though the initial priority for calls and chat can be set, this doesn't overrule that we always prioritize calls

You can influence the priority of text interactions by setting waiting times, or starvation periods: after a number of seconds, the priority of a text interaction is changed from 3 or 2 to 1 so that the AID routes it first.

17 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1008

Understanding Digital Channels

Priority of Text Interactions

This feature is located under Profiles > Information > Increase email priority after (seconds). Configure each profile separately. To give priority to a profile, set the starvation periods to a low number.

Aligning VCC and SCC Priorities. Digital Engagement priorities range from 1-100, with 100 being the highest priority. These values are set in the Priority tab of the IVR Skill Transfer module and align with SCC priorities of one through three, with one being the highest priority. These priorities align as follows:

l VCC priority 61-100 = SCC priority 1

l VCC priority 31-60 = SCC priority 2

l VCC priority 0-30 = SCC priority 3

To avoid starvation, set priorities to VCC 100/SCC 1, VCC 99/SCC 2, VCC 98/SCC 3 for existing items in queue.

Profiles with varying priority:

Profile Default High Priority Medium Priority Low Priority Email 300 seconds 5 seconds 200 seconds 400 seconds

Chat 30 seconds 1 second 15 seconds 40 seconds

Social 300 seconds 5 seconds 200 seconds 400 seconds

To test routing priority, follow these steps:

1 Ensure that agents are set to AID mode for the text items.

2 Send email, chat, and social interactions with low priority first, followed by

medium priority, and finally high priority.

The high priority interactions are routed before the medium priority interactions, which are routed before the low priority interactions.

Business Rules and Interaction Processing

By default, Agent Desktop Plus assigns incoming interactions the MEDIUM priority and routes items to agents on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. Any business rules that you define to override the default FIFO round-robin routing algorithm take precedence over the system defaults. For example, you might define business rules that a HIGH priority to items coming into the queue from a certain Facebook fan page; those interactions

18 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1009

Understanding Digital Channels

Priority of Text Interactions

will be processed first, and might even be sent to agents belonging to a specific skill group.

In addition to business rules, you set starvation periods to prevent items of MEDIUM and LOW priorities don’t wait endlessly in the media queue. A starvation period is the period of time an item waits for some action such as, assignment to an agent or transfer of an item to a different agent or returning the item to the media queue.

As the NLP engine learns to recognize terms used in text interactions for a certain profile, it might also assign priorities to incoming items as they enter the queue.

Priority Updates for Items in the Media Queue

After an item enters the media queue, the priority can be based on activity, rules, and waiting times. These events can increase the priority:

l An item reaches the maximum waiting time for a specified starvation period.

l An item is transferred to another agent.

l An item is returned to the media queue because it was not accepted by an agent

before the time-out. When an item is returned to the media queue, the priority is automatically raised to the next priority level. Starvation settings apply.

Digital in Admin Console

This content guides you through the process of migrating from SCC Admin to Admin Console. The migration introduces several key features designed to enhance administrative capabilities and streamline management processes.

Features:

l Migrate Existing SCC Admin Data: Seamlessly transfer all existing SCC admin data

to the new Admin Console, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption.

l Configure Digital Entities: Admin Console now allows you to configure various

digital entities including email, chat, and global digital settings, providing a centralized platform for digital management.

l New Email Authentication Method: Introduce an additional user authentication

method for email, enhancing security and flexibility for user access.

Benefits:

l Unified Administrator Experience: Admin Console offers a unified experience

where administrators can configure and manage both Digital and Voice settings in one place, simplifying the administrative workflow.

l Intuitive User Interface: Enjoy a new, intuitive user experience in the Admin

Console that makes navigation and configuration easier and more efficient.

To initiate the migration, select any Digital tab under Manage Environment. During the migration, Chat and Email operations will not be affected. All SCC Admin data will be accessible in the Admin Console under the corresponding pages.

Note

After enabling the domain for Admin Console in Digital, SCC Admin will switch to read-only mode for Email, Chat, and Global Digital Settings. Admin can access the Reports tab in SCC Admin.

Digital Chat Profiles General Tab

In this tab, you can configure the chat presentation options, such as Enable Auto Chat Bot, Time to accept, Auto-Accept, queuing options, and also define your transcript options.

The Auto-Accept option automatically accepts interactions on behalf of agents. When enabled, the timer is disabled, and agents automatically receive interactions in their assigned queues without the ability to reject them.

If manual selection is enabled, interactions are added to the agents' list of assigned interactions. These interactions open in their application when agents click the browser notification of a new digital engagement interaction. To prevent agents from automatically accepting new interactions when they click browser notifications, you can:

l Disable browser notifications (see Managing Browser Notifications for Agents).

l Disable Auto-Accept for one or more channels.

Agents must accept interactions within a specified number of seconds. The Time to accept setting applies to the AID mode and can be set for each interaction type. The default setting is 30 seconds, but you can increase it up to 60 seconds.

When routing interactions by priority, the default value for email and social interactions is 5 minutes. For chat interactions, the recommended value is 5 minutes. New profiles are automatically set to 5 minutes.

Digital Chat Profiles Agent Stickiness Tab

Agent Stickiness allows you to define how the system assigns digital engagement interactions for returning contacts. For new contacts, the system ignores these settings and routes the item to the next available agent.

This feature enables the system to manage the distribution of digital engagement interactions instead of the ACD. Before distributing an item, the system checks which agent previously handled the returning contact within the configured historical age for a match. If that agent becomes available within the configured minutes to wait, the system offers the interaction to that same agent.

If the timer expires, or if the assigned agent rejects or ignores the interaction, the system returns the interaction to the queue for distribution. If an agent logs out while there is an offered sticky interaction, the system will return the interaction to the queue after the timer expires.

Note

An agent logged in with cherry-pick mode can lock an interaction while it is being offered to another agent due to stickiness. Agent stickiness set- tings do not consider business hours.

Time to wait

Maximum time to wait in minutes for the previous agent to become available and receive the chat interaction.

Historical age for match

Number of days to search the contact’s history to locate the last agent who handled the previous interaction with the contact. If the interaction is older than the setting, Agent Stickiness is not applied. This setting is a sliding 24-hour window and refers to calendar days. This setting does not consider business hours or holidays.

Dynamic wait message

In situations where the wait time surpasses one minute, this prompt takes precedence over the standard Wait Message. Otherwise, the system will revert to displaying the designated Wait Message. If the message contains the tag "<wait>" then the system replaces the tag in the message with the estimated wait time in minutes.

35 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

Digital Chat Profiles

The system calculates the waiting time every three minutes based on the past hour. This calculation includes only chats that are assigned to an agent. During the three-minute intervals, the same waiting time is displayed regardless of how many or how quickly chat interactions are delivered to agents. The wait time is rounded up to the next second, so the wait time is two minutes if the calculated time is 61 seconds.

Displayed once the chat interaction has ended.

Goodbye message

Displayed when no agents are logged into the profile.

No service message

Displayed when the assigned agent has become unavailable, the chat is being assigned to another agent.

Transfer/Re- queue message

Enable Comfort Message Define the automated comfort messages displayed to a contact if the agent is taking too long to reply. The timer begins when the customer responds and restarts when the agent sends a message. Similarly, inactivity by the contact can start an option to automatically close the chat window.

Note

The customer-idle time restarts when a chat interaction is transferred to another agent.

Important

If you use the agent-idle timer and the automatic close option you can potentially send confusing messages to your customers. You must carefully plan the timing of your agent-idle timer messages and the close inactive interaction timer to avoid these situations.

Example

In this scenario, the agent idle timer is configured for 30 seconds and an automatic close timer configured for 180 seconds. If agents are unresponsive, you can produce a confusing interaction for your customers, as outlined below:

l The agent is busy. A comfort message is sent at 30th, 60th, and 90th

second saying I am still researching your ...

36 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1027

Digital in Admin Console

Digital Chat Profiles

l At the same time, at the 90th second, a warning is displayed to the

customer: I have not heard from you for a while...

l Now the customer is confused. The customer has nothing to say because

the agent is still researching. So the customer waits.

l At 120th and 150th second intervals, additional comfort messages are

displayed to the customer: I am still researching your… because the agent is still busy or unresponsive.

l At the 180th second the chat is automatically closed due to inactivity.

No timer setting is generic for all because every contact center is different. You must carefully balance the timing of your messages with the responsiveness and task load of your agents. If your agents typically respond to chat interactions within 30 seconds, the scenario described above presents no problem or confusion to your customers. They would never receive the agent-idle comfort messages. Once an agent initially responds to the chat, the agent-idle timer is turned off and the customer no longer receives agent-idle comfort messages.

The reminder message is disabled by default. To configure the reminder message:

1 Select the Enable Comfort Message option.

2 Configure the agent-idle time interval.

You can configure a time interval from 30 to 600 seconds (default is 120 seconds). Any text entry in the chat by the agent resets this timer. With no agent activity this message is sent at the defined interval.

3 Define a Comfort message containing up to 2,000 characters.

3 Set an inactivity time limit.

You can configure any time from 30 to 600 seconds. The default time to automatically close an inactive interaction is 180 seconds.

4 Define a Auto-close warning message containing up to 2,000 characters.

The default message is I haven’t heard from you in a while, are you still there?

The Auto-close warning message displays when one half of your customer idle timer has passed. The idle timer restarts with any new text entry from the customer.

5 Define a Auto-close message comtaining message up to 2,000 characters.

The default message is Chat closed due to customer inactivity. If you enable this option, you must define automatic close warning and timer settings.

OAuth2 Client Credential Digital Email Configurations

Set up an email configuration to utilize a single main service account for Microsoft 365 (o365) while integrating additional sub-mail accounts. These sub-mail accounts, granted access to the main account, are processed through the Five9 Email Proxy. This approach enables authentication via the main service account, removing the need for individual authentication of each sub-mail account.

Before starting, ensure that you configure the service accounts in Microsoft Azure and grant Five9 the necessary permissions to access the designated inboxes. This setup guarantees smooth email communication between your organization’s email system and the Five9 platform.

When selecting this authentication type, the interface allows you to choose from existing service accounts or create a new one. The configured service account will manage both inbound and outbound email configurations.

Important

You cannot associate an OAuth2 token with more than one campaign. Tokens are campaign-specific and cannot be reused across multiple cam- paigns. Ensure each token is assigned to a single campaign to maintain proper functionality.

Important

You cannot associate an OAuth2 token with more than one campaign. Tokens are campaign-specific and cannot be reused across multiple cam- paigns. Ensure each token is assigned to a single campaign to maintain proper functionality.

Granting Administrator Consent You have three options for consent.

Option 1: Sign in Using Administrator Credentials

To obtain admin consent using administrator credentials, follow these steps:

1 Select Have an admin account? Sign in with that account, and sign in using

domain administrator credentials.

2 After authentication, select Consent on behalf of your organization.

Important

Ensure that you are signed in to the correct account for your business. When generating a token, Microsoft O365 will default to your currently logged-in account. Five9 will download emails from the current account. Five9 recommends using the same credentials for both the Campaign Email Address and OAuth2 configuration AD administrator.

Option 2: Authenticate Using Administrator Consent

To authenticate using administrator consent, follow these steps.

1 Share the appropriate admin consent screen link with the tenant administrator

based on your location:

o For Five9.com users:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_ id=<us_client_id>

o For Five9.eu users:

2 Replace <us_client_id> and <eu_client_id> with the actual Five9 application

IDs.

3 When prompted, authenticate and select Accept.

4 Once consent has been granted, you can begin adding tokens.

Option 3: Authenticate Using Powershell and Azure AD

To obtain admin consent using PowerShell and Azure AD, follow these steps:

1 Connect to Azure AD in PowerShell and create a new service principal using one

of the following commands, based on your location:

o For Five9.com users:

2 Replace <us_client_id> and <eu_client_id> with the actual Five9 application

IDs.

3 Open the Azure AD administration screen, go to Enterprise Applications, and

search for Five9 applications.

4 Select the application name, then go to Permissions.

5 Select Grant consent for <application>, then select Accept.

Setting the Media Types for Digital Engagement Channels

For each user, you can define the allowed types of interactions. Depending on their assigned skills, agents can interact with your customers through voice and any combination of digital engagement channels. Agents respond to incoming requests coming from email, chat, or social tools, such as Facebook and Twitter. Digital engagement channels are available only in inbound campaigns. Voice interactions can be configured in inbound and outbound campaigns.

If your contact center uses digital engagement channels in addition to voice, specify which channels each agent can use and the maximum number (Max Allowed) of each

Configuring Digital Engagement Channels

Configuring the VCC Administrator Application

type of interaction that the agent can have at any time. In this example, the agent is allowed to engage in all media channels.

Important

Agents assigned a video channel may be allowed a maximum of one chat because video sessions use chat to route customer video requests.

If Intelligent Routing is enabled for the digital engagement channels, incoming interactions are automatically presented to the agent to accept or reject until the specified maximum number is reached. If Intelligent Routing is not checked, the agent can select interactions manually (or cherry pick) from the queue. In this example, Social is enabled so the agent may select a new social request from the queue if the agent has not reached the specified limit. For more information about media settings using Five9 Engagement Workflow, see Five9 Engagement Workflow.

Five9 recommends that you do not mix in the same queue or profile agents who use intelligent routing and choose interactions manually.

Example

If agents are assigned to ACME Support skill, all agents should use the same mode to receive interactions. A mixture of AID and manual assignment may result in conflicts when one agent attempts to manually select an interaction that is delivered to another agent in AID.

Displaying the Distribution of a User’s Interaction Methods

Digital engagement interactions are distributed from queues to agents by one of these methods: Automatic Interaction Distributor (AID) or manual selection by the agent (cherry pick). You can use only one method for each agent at any time.

Note

You cannot use manual selection with preview chat, which is a type of proactive chat. For more information about chat types and configuration, see Understanding Chat Types.

Automatic Distribution Automatic Distribution is similar to the Automated Call Distributor used for voice interactions. It pushes items to an agent when agents become available if they have the skill. digital engagement interactions are routed to agents in a round-robin fashion based on the longest agent waiting time. Currently, preview chat is supported in AID mode only. When an agent receives a chat preview, they are able to select the contact details and journey as a part of this preview for review before making a decision to engage with the contact.

Manual Distribution Agents are allowed to view the Media Stream queue and select items one at a time. Agents can use their Settings menu to change the sort order of items in the Queue Media Stream or the Assigned Media Stream. Agents can change this setting in the Text Filters menu.

Setting the Time to Accept Interactions Agents must accept interactions within a specified number of seconds. The Time to Accept setting applies to the AID mode, which can be set for each interaction type. The default setting is 30 seconds. You can increase the time up to 60 seconds.

Setting the Priority of Digital Engagement Interactions When routing interactions by priority, the default value for email and social interactions is 300 seconds. For chat interactions, the recommended value for existing profiles is 300 seconds. New profiles are automatically set to 300 seconds.

Defining Your Chat Welcome and Goodbye Messages

If you want to use chat messages different from those defined in the profile, enter the text for your chat Welcome and Goodbye messages.

Verifying a User’s Group Association

A group in the Digital Engagement console is equivalent to a queue (skill) in the VCC. The agent must already be assigned to the equivalent queue in the VCC administrator application.

When the VCC settings are synchronized to the Digital Engagement Administrator console, user definitions are associated with a group. You may want to associate users with a certain group, which is helpful to distribute agents to assist with the workload of a different group. To distribute agents, you must do so in the VCC Administrator or Supervisor application where you can also add and remove skills.

Select the Group from the list on the left. You should see the boxes checked for each user you want to see in that group.

Defining Agent Stickiness for Distributing Interactions

For each profile, you can define how the system assigns digital engagement interactions for returning contacts. For new contacts, the system ignores these settings and routes the item to the next available agent.

This feature enables the system to manage the distribution of digital engagement interactions instead of the ACD. Before an item is distributed, the system determines which agent assigned to that profile handled the previous interaction with the returning contact, within the time range of the configured Historical age for match. If that agent becomes available within the configured Minutes to wait (for chat or email), the interaction is offered to that same agent.

Once the Minutes to wait (for chat or email) timer has expired, or if the assigned agent rejects or ignores the interaction, it is returned to the queue for distribution. If an agent logs out while there is an offered sticky interaction, the interaction will be returned to the queue after Minutes to wait (for chat or email) timer has expired.

Campaigns must always include at least one closed disposition type to complete all interactions and prevent system errors.

2 Select the call disposition type and related options.

l Redial number

You can specify the redial time by selecting Use redial timer and entering the time to wait before trying the number again. This option also allows you to enable Allow agents to change reactivation time. The dialer attempts to dial the number as soon as possible, after that time, stopping somewhere in the call list to place the call, and then starting where it left off. You can also specify the maximum number if agents consecutively select this disposition multiple times.

o Redial number after duration: Specify the days, hours, and minutes to

redial this number. The dialer redials the number as soon as possible after the specified time.

o Number of redial attempts: If agents consecutively set this disposition

multiple times, this is the maximum number of redials the dialer attempts.

o Allow agents to change redial time: In the Five9 Agent application, the

disposition displays an additional menu to select a redial time. The time configured in the redial timer setting is also shown to agents as the default option for this disposition. When an agent specifies a redial time,

the phone number is redialed by the campaign at the designated time and the call is delivered to any available agent that is qualified for the campaign.

This feature is useful for outbound customers whose agents work in shifts, such as when agents in the morning shift need to schedule campaign-related callbacks for agents in the evening shift.

Profile and disposition counters apply to individual numbers in a record, not to the entire record. The profile and disposition counters restrict dialing to individual numbers within a record, rather than to the entire record.

When using redial dispositions, consider these points:

o Numbers without a redial timer are considered for dialing by a campaign

on next cycle through the list.

o Numbers with a redial timer is dialed again after the time specified.

o The dialer does not dial numbers with redial timers set when going

through the list again. It only calls the number at the set time.

o If a number receives the same redial disposition consecutively, the dialer

stops attempts when the number of attempts is reached.

o If a redial timer is set, the dialer does not call alternate phone numbers on

the contact record until redialing the first number.

o If no redial timer is set, the dialer begins calling the contact record's

alternate phone numbers on its first pass of the list.

o If Allow agents to change redial time is selected, the redial timer set by

agents works in the same way and follows the same rules as the redial timer set by administrators.

Example

Redial without redial timer: the campaign starts at 10:00AM; records are dialed consecutively.

1 At 10:10AM, the campaign dials a number that is assigned to a

Redial Number disposition without a redial timer set.

2 By 2:00PM, the campaign has called all records in the list. This

cycle of dialing took four hours.

3 By 2:30PM, the campaign reaches the number again that was

assigned a disposition with a Redial Number disposition: the campaign attempts to dial the number again four hours 20 minutes after the first attempt.

1 Dial list (first pass) 2 Dial list (second pass)

Example

Redial with redial timer: the campaign starts at 10:00AM; records are dialed consecutively.

1 At 10:10AM, the campaign dials a number that was assigned a

disposition as Busy (the Busy system disposition is a Redial Number disposition with the Redial After = 5 minutes and the Number of Attempts = 5).

2 By 10:15AM, the campaign tries the number again (5 minutes

after receiving the original Busy disposition). It receives Busy again.

3 Four more attempts are made at 10:20AM, 10:25AM, 10:30AM,

and 10:35AM. The number continues to be busy. The dialer stops dialing the number because the maximum number of attempts (5)

was reached with this disposition.

l Do not dial for campaign

When you select this type, the number is not dialed by the campaign, but other numbers from the contact record are dialed unless the Apply to all numbers in this contact record option is enabled. If the number exists in other contact records in the list, it can be dialed without restrictions. This type of disposition has two options:

o Apply to all numbers in this contact record: The dialer does not dial any

number in the contact record, not just the dispositioned number.

o Use timer to reactivate number: The dialer does not dial the number in

the current campaign. Set the days, hours, and minutes to allow the dialer to call the number after that time. It dials the number the next time it passes through the list after the set time. If you select this option, you can also enable the Allow agents to change reactivation time: This option is available once the Use timer to reactivate number option is selected. Allows agents to set the number reactivation time. The time configured in the Activate number after duration setting is also shown to agents as the default option for this disposition. When an agent specifies a reactivation time, the campaign reactivates that number at the designated time and the dialer delivers the call to any available agent qualified for the campaign.

107 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

Example: Without an activation timer: A record contains three numbers. The first number is assigned a do not dial disposition. Because every contact record can have up to three numbers to dial, the other two numbers are still dialed. However, if Apply to All Numbers in This Contact Record is enabled, no contact record numbers are dialed.

Example: With an activation timer: A called party asks not to be called again for at least two hours. The dialer skips the number on the next pass in one and 1/2 hours as it is before the timer setting. The dialer calls the number in its next pass three hours after the set timer.

If the dialer is in vertical dialing mode, it does not wait until the three-hour mark to call the number. It calls the number when the timer expires.

l Final disposition for contact record

When you select this type of disposition, the contact record, including alternate phone numbers, is not dialed again by the campaign. A final decision has been made, such as Application taken or Not interested. This type of disposition has one option:

o Apply final disposition to all contact records in the campaign lists that

use this disposition. When you select this option, the contact record is not dialed in any campaign that contains this disposition. A final disposition can be applied to multiple campaigns when the other campaigns are using this same disposition.

Note

If a contact record was in a campaign with this option enabled in a final disposition, its numbers may still be called if it is assigned to a new campaign.

l Add number to DNC list

When using the Add Number to DNC List option, the customer's individual number or entire contact record is placed in the local Do Not Call list for the

108 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

Monitoring Digital Engagement Interactions and Activity

domain. Choosing this option enables the disposition options described in the example below.

You can assign this option to one number in a contact record, for example, if a customer only wants one number placed on the DNC list, but is available at the other numbers.

Example

A called party asked for one or all phone numbers to not be called again. There are the following options:

o Add the dialed number: Adds only the current number (the

number dialed) to the DNC list.

o Add the dialed number and finalize the contact record for this

campaign: Adds the current number and makes the record final for the campaign. This option stops dialing this record for this campaign but does not add the contact’s other phone numbers to the DNC list. The alternate numbers in the contact record are still available for other campaigns.

o Add all numbers and finalize the contact record for this

campaign: Adds all phone numbers for the contact record to the DNC list. The alternate numbers are not available for any campaign.

3 Click Next to configure answering machine settings.

Answering Machine You set custom dispositions and the system Answering Machine disposition on the Answering Machine tab. Agents can set the Answering Machine disposition as soon as they connect to an answering machine and are ready for other tasks.

1 Click the drop-down list for Action on disposition selection and select an option.

The options are:

o Do not leave message: No further action.

o Play prompt: Switches the call to a message prompt line to allow the

agent to disconnect from the call. The message plays after detecting two seconds of silence or when set by the Max answering machine greeting time (sec) option. You can only configure one message prompt per

109 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1100

Configuring Digital Engagement Channels

Monitoring Digital Engagement Interactions and Activity

disposition. The prompt is played either after a two second silence is detected (for example, after the tone, please leave a message... beep) or after the configured Max answering machine greeting time (sec). One prompt can be configured per disposition. You must select the prompt from the drop-down list.

o Play IVR script (advanced): Agents who are connected to an answering

machine or voicemail box can disconnect from a call but leave a message playing for an answering machine. The IVR script plays after a two-second silence is detected (for example, after the tone, please leave a message... beep) or after the configured Max answering machine greeting time (sec). You must select an IVR script from the drop-down list.

The default Max answering machine greeting time (sec) is 5. If an outbound campaign that uses these answering machine prompt/IVR dispositions dials many cell phone numbers, Five9 recommends setting a longer greeting time, such as 40 seconds, due to the often longer voicemail greeting messages.

You can use branching logic or dynamic Text-to-Speech when leaving a message. For example, to configure an IVR script that plays a personalized message from the agent assigned to the call, you can configure a Case module, with the Agent.user_name variable and connect the branches to one Play module for each agent. Another example would be to leave a message with dynamic Text- to-Speech, which can play information such as an account balance to a client.

2 Click Done to save the new disposition.

Disposition Menu, and add the disposition:

Configuring Dispositions in SCC

Note

This topic applies if your domain existed before R12 and you have not enabled unified dispositions.

Early releases support configuring dispositions in both SCC and VCC. Release 13 and later support configuring dispositions in VCC or Admin Console. Refer to Adding Custom Definitions in VCC in Basic Con- figuration for steps in creating a new custom disposition in VCC. New domains should have unified dispositions only. For information on con- figuring dispositions in Admin console, see Configuring Dispositions in Admin Console.

Digital engagement channel dispositions apply to email, chat, and social interactions. Unlike voice dispositions, digital engagement dispositions can represent the in-progress or the final status:

l Open: Enables agents to mark items in progress. The items remain open and

visible to agents but are not reported.

l Close: Ends the work for the item. Closed items are removed from the agent’s

view. In reports, the item is Closed.

l Transfer: Enables agents to mark items in progress. The items remain open and

visible to agents but are not reported.

Example

Your agent received an email. The agent replied to the customer and is now waiting for the customer to respond. In this case, the agent would select a disposition such as Open – Awaiting customer feedback. When the customer contacts the agent again, the agent closes the interaction with one of the Close dispositions that you created. At that time, reports are updated with the final disposition.

Important

Campaigns must always include at least one closed disposition type to complete all interactions and prevent system errors. For more information on types of disposiitions, see Disposition Types in Basic Configuration.

Related digital engagement interactions are not linked. Therefore when customers reply to an email, this email becomes a new email interaction instead of being linked to the original interaction. The agent sets a disposition for both related interactions with a Close disposition. Reports show the closed dispositions.

You may define multiple dispositions in each category. Agents see only the name of the disposition. Therefore, be sure to enter a descriptive name. When done, select the type of disposition. Your dispositions are listed alphabetically in the navigation pane.

Defining Assistance Responses

Assistances are predefined responses that agents can use during chat, email, or social posts to respond to the customer’s question by sending a predefined answer. These predefined responses for assistance are designed to answer typical questions or to provide directions for a common situation.

Note

Assistance responses do not pass inline images for all email providers.

Creating Simple Assistances Simple assistances are common responses to routine interactions designed to save the agent time and effort while increasing consistency. For example, an assistance might provide instructions to reset a password or send a link to instructions.

Five9 Engagement Workflow

Five9 Engagement Workflow enables you to provide more guidance and detail to your digital engagement channel routing solutions. Much of Five9 Engagement Workflow resides within IVR functionality. For additional information on routing solutions and Engagement Workflow IVR script templates, refer to the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Administrator's Guide.

By default, such things as sending customer email replies to the agent profile associated with the skill in the original interaction, are automatic and require no additional configuration.

You can further augment your Engagement Workflow using a customized Drools file for use with your Five9RulesEngine IVR module. This rules and Drools creation and use is described here and installed into your Digital Engagement Administrator console.

Configuring Your Five9 Rules Configuring Your VCC to Route Salesforce Objects Example IVR Scripts for Engagement Workflow

Configuring Your Five9 Rules

Your Five9 Rules Engine definition file is a Drools file (.drl), which is written in Java. It enables you to apply logic to the data found in your email interactions.

Important

To configure a Drools file, you must have a working knowledge of Java.

120 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1111

Five9 Engagement Workflow

Configuring Your Five9 Rules

Five9 Rules Engine Objects

In the Five9 Rules Engine, the Drools file references two objects: WorkItem and Dynamic Attributes.

Work Item The WorkItem attribute contains the interaction ID of the email interaction. When the interaction ID is passed to the Five9 Rules Engine, the WorkItem object makes all parts of the email available for manipulation. If the interaction ID is not passed, data manipulation is limited to the content of DynamicAttributes.

Dynamic Attributes DynamicAttributes objects are key-value (KV) pairs, both string values, that serve as input and output for the Five9 Rules Engine. These attributes are unique to your domain. The Five9 Rules Engine accesses, modifies, then returns your KV list to the IVR with enhanced routing options or recommended actions for the agent.

To pass attributes to your Five9 rules engine, follow these steps:

1 Request the parameters and attributes.

You can create dynamic attributes to be passed to the Five9 rules engine by using an IVR Query module. In the example below you send a raw JSON request to dynamically extract attributes specific to campaign and interaction.

Query JSON request:

{"CampaignID": "&&Call.campaign.id&&","interaction.id": "&&Omni.interaction_id&&","attributes: "&&attributes&&"}

121 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1112

Five9 Engagement Workflow

Configuring Your Five9 Rules

The value of attributes is also a simple JSON request, such as:

{"body": "","number1": "555-123-4567","cookie monster": "Cookies Yum!"}

2 Capture the query response.

You can configure the Query module response tab to create a JSON response object, such as this regular expression (RegEx) example:

For this response: {"status": 1, "numberOfRulesFired": 1,"attributes": {"body": "","number1": "555-123-4567", "cookieMonster": "Cookies Yum!:}}

The RegEx detail is: \{\s*\"status\"\:\s(.+?)\,\s*\"numberOfRulesFired\"\:\s* (.+?)\,\s*\"attributes\"\:\s*(\{[\s\w\d-":,!]*\}?)\s*\}

In this example, you are creating three capture groups for the following objects:

l status

l numberOrRulesFired

l attributes

122 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1113

Five9 Engagement Workflow

Configuring Your Five9 Rules

The status and numberOfRulesFired objects are useful for error handling.

For more information about configuring the IVR Query Module, see the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Administrator's Guide.

Error Handling This sample JSON response shows that a rule failed: {"status": 0, "numberOfRulesFired": -1,"attributes": {"body": "","number1": "555-123-4567", "cookieMonster": "Cookies Yum!:}}

Notice status = 0and numberOfRulesFired = -1.

Use these conditions to implement fallback routing options if your rules engine fails.

Assembling Your Drools File

The following methods are available for building your Drools file to access and manipulate data. An example key-value pair used in the sample Drools file below is Customer Value (key), with possible values being gold, silver, or platinum. You can configure you IVR Query Module to pass dynamic attributes, as shown below:

Workitem Write Methods Workitem write methods use attribute names and values defined by the Digital Engagement Administrator, such as Customer Value.

public void addNextBestAction(String actionName,String description) public void tagItem(String tagName, String priority) public void setAttribute(String attributeName, String atttributeValueName, boolean overwrite)

Workitem Read Method This method retrieves the email body, up to 20k characters. public String getBody()

DynamicAttributes Write Methods

public void set(String keyName, String|Integer|Boolean|Long|Double keyValue)

Using the SightCall Standard Installer

The benefit to using the standard installer is the SightCall automatic upgrade system. Deploying any new version overwrites the previous version. While the standard system installer can be used for bulk installation, SightCall recommends browser installation for each user.

l Users do not have write access to personal folders.

l Personal folders are remote with limited resources.

l Corporate policy prohibits installing programs in personal folders.

l Workstations are shared by several users. SightCall recommends that you completely remove your SightCall installation when switching between a standard and admin installer. Removal must be performed by a system administrator using the command lines shown below.

Chat Interactions

Chat interactions enable you to close a sale, prevent the abandonment of shopping carts, anticipate a customer’s support request, and handle the request with chat instead of voice, which has a higher cost.

Important

Five9 does not recommend sending shared attachments with personally identifiable information (PII) data. Any attachment with PII should be attached directly to only one contact. If you choose to send an attach- ment with PII data to multiple users, the compliance responsibility for the California Consumer Privacy Act (CaCPA) and the General Data Pro- tection Regulation (GDPR) is your responsibility to address. Five9 will only purge attachments that are related to a single user. If you use an attachment to send to multiple users when we purge for one of the users then that shared attachment will also be purged.

Understanding Chat Types

Five9 offers several chat types to best match your business needs:

Basic Chat Basic chat offers an additional interaction media type to your customers through desktop and mobile applications. A basic chat interaction enables you to capture and retain customer data by using a form that customers can complete before engaging in the chat interaction. Basic chat is presented to your customers as a Chat Now or similar button with an optional form following a click event.

150 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1141

Configuring Chat Interactions

Proactive Chat Proactive chat offers are tailored to enhance customer support and lead or sale conversion by using specific triggers, such as time spent on a page, a series of clicks, or mouse hover time.

Example

A customer makes repeated visits to a product description or an FAQ topic. You can offer assistance in the form of a chat. When the customer clicks Start Live Chat in one of your web pages, an interaction is queued for the next available chat agent.

Preview Chat Preview chat is a subset of proactive chat that provides the same elements as proactive chat.

Important

Preview chat overrides proactive chat.

Preview chat generates a proactive chat request based on the customer’s context data, browsing behavior, and demographic information. Agents can then prepare a personalized chat message before engaging the customer.

To use preview and proactive chat, you must define separate preview and proactive chat profiles in the Digital Engagement Administrator interface. For more information, see Configuring Profiles to Support Proactive and Preview Chat.

Configuring Language Options for Real Time Translation Real Time Translation uses Google Translate to translate the user's text from a configured or unconfigured language to English for the agent. Real Time Translation only applies to the actual translation within the message between the agent and the user. You can configure the localization and fields to appear in the user's selected language by setting those options on the Language tab and the Fields tab (see Configuring Fields Options).

Important: In order to provide real-time translations of chat conversations on our service, we may use third parties if both parties are writing in different languages. Such conversations will be subject to those third parties' data usage practices. For more information, please refer to our Sub processor List.

Configuring Chat Routing and Abandon Options In Profiles > Chat, you can define the behavior of web chat and asynchronous messages when they are received after business hours and when no agents are logged into the system. Enabling each routing setting below allows you to define the system message that is displayed to the corresponding setting.

Configuring Routing of Web Chats

If you select the Enable routing of web chat after business hours: option, web chats received outside of business hours are routed as usual. If you enable this setting, you may also define the After hours message for web chat.

If you select the Enable routing of web chat when no agents are logged in: option and routing after business hours is not enabled, web chats are routed as usual even if no agents are logged in and active. If you enable this setting, you may also define the Web chat wait message when no agents are logged in.

Set the Time to abandon web chats: in Days, Hours and Minutes that you want Five9 to abandon a still-open web chat that is unassigned. By default, web chats are abandoned after 1 day (24 hours), but you can keep them up to 7 days (168 hours). The system displays a warning message if you set a time less than 30 minutes or more than 7 days.

Five9 also abandons native chats automatically if the end-user chat client disconnects and the end-user does not re-connect within approximately three minutes.

Configuring Routing of Asynchronous Messages

If you select the Enable routing of non-SMS asynchronous messages after business hours: option, non-SMS asynchronous messages received outside of business hours are routed as usual. If you enable this setting, you may also define the .After hours message for non-SMS asynchronous messages.

If you select the Enable routing of non-SMS asynchronous messages when no agents are logged in: option and routing after business hours is not enabled, non-SMS asynchronous messages are routed as usual even if no agents are logged in and active. If you enable this setting, you may also define the Non-SMS asynchronous wait message when no agents are logged in.

Set the Time to abandon asynchronous messages: in Days, Hours and Minutes that you want Five9 to abandon a still-open chat that is unassigned. By default, non-SMS asynchronous messages are abandoned after 7 days, but you can set the time to keep them less than 7 days. The system displays a warning message if you set a time less than 30 minutes or more than 7 days.

Asynchronous messages are created by the Five9 messaging API. Time to abandon asynchronous messages: applies to messages created with any sub-media type except "GENERIC". If the message sub-media type is "GENERIC", then the Time to abandon web chats: configuration applies.

Note

If an inbound web chat or asynchronous message is transferred to another campaign, the time to abandon and business hour settings of the originating campaign persist.

Configuring Chat Inactivity Options

Enabling Automated Reminder (Comfort) Messages

In Profiles > Chat, you can define the automated comfort messages displayed to a contact if the agent is taking too long to reply. The timer begins when the customer responds and restarts when the agent sends a message. Similarly, inactivity by the contact can start an option to automatically close the chat window.

Note

The customer-idle time restarts when a chat interaction is transferred to another agent.

Important

If you use the agent-idle timer and the automatic close option you can potentially send confusing messages to your customers. You must carefully plan the timing of your agent-idle timer messages and the close inactive interaction timer to avoid these situations.

l The agent is busy. A comfort message is sent at 30th, 60th, and 90th

second saying I am still researching your ...

l At the same time, at the 90th second, a warning is displayed to the

customer: I have not heard from you for a while...

l Now the customer is confused. The customer has nothing to say because

the agent is still researching. So the customer waits.

l At 120th and 150th second intervals, additional comfort messages are

displayed to the customer: I am still researching your… because the agent is still busy or unresponsive.

l At the 180th second the chat is automatically closed due to inactivity.

No timer setting is generic for all because every contact center is different. You must carefully balance the timing of your messages with the responsiveness and task load of your agents. If your agents typically respond to chat interactions within 30 seconds, the scenario described above presents no problem or confusion to your customers. They would never receive the agent-idle comfort messages. Once an agent initially responds to the chat, the agent-idle timer is turned off and the customer no longer receives agent-idle comfort messages.

Configuring the Reminder Message

The reminder message is disabled by default. To configure the reminder message, follow these steps.

1 To enable this feature, select the Enable Comfort Message option.

2 Configure the agent-idle time interval.

You can configure a time interval from 30 to 600 seconds (default is 120 seconds). Any text entry in the chat by the agent resets this timer. With no agent activity this message is sent at the defined interval.

3 Enable the Comfort message option and define a message containing up to

2,000 characters.

The default comfort message is I am still researching. Thanks for the patience. If you enable this option, you must define a comfort message.

Closing the Chat Window Automatically

The chat automatic close feature is disabled by default. To configure automatic close for inactive chat sessions, follow these steps.

1 Select the Enable Auto-Close option.

2 Set an inactivity time limit.

You can configure any time from 30 to 600 seconds. The default time to automatically close an inactive interaction is 180 seconds.

3 Configure the auto-close warning message.

The default message is I haven’t heard from you in a while. Are you still there? You can define any message containing up to 2,000 characters.

The automatic close warnings displays when one half of your customer idle timer has passed. The idle timer restarts with any new text entry from the customer.

4 Configure your automatic close message.

The default message is Chat auto-closed due to customer inactivity. You can define any message up to 2,000 characters. If you enable this option, you must define automatic close warning and automatic close timer settings.

No timer setting is generic for all because every contact center is different. You must carefully balance the timing of your messages with the responsiveness and task load of your agents. If your agents typically respond to chat interactions within 30 seconds, the scenario described above presents no problems or confusion to your customers, they would never receive the agent-idle comfort messages.

5 Configure your chatbot automatic close message.

The default message is The session with the virtual agent has timed out. To continue the conversation, start another session. You can define any message up to 2,000 characters. If you enable this option, you must define automatic close warning and automatic close timer settings.

l Dynamic Wait Message: In situations where the wait time surpasses one

minute, this prompt takes precedence over the standard Wait Message. Otherwise, the system will revert to displaying the designated Wait Message.

If the message contains the tag "<wait>" then the system replaces the tag in the message with the estimated wait time in minutes.

The system calculates the waiting time every three minutes based on the past hour. This calculation includes only chats that are assigned to an agent. During the three-minute intervals, the same waiting time is displayed regardless of how many or how quickly chat interactions are delivered to agents. The wait time is rounded up to the next second, so the wait time is two minutes if the calculated time is 61 seconds.

l Goodbye Message: Displayed once the chat interaction has ended.

Configuring Proactive Chat

Proactive chat differs from a standard link to chat in that it offers chat invitations to your customers in the form of a pop-up window that opens as customers navigate through your web site. Your agents see chat messages as soon as they log in even if they are not set to Ready.

Use proactive chat to display a chat offer to your visitors. You define the parameters based on the visitor’s navigation pattern across the web site or within specific pages of a web site. A prompt such as this example enables the visitor to start a chat session. The visitor has an opportunity to either accept or reject the offer.

Your web designer can implement proactive chat and design the prompt and the chat form with JavaScript and CSS. Five9 proactive chat is triggered by time on page, number of pages visited, or hover time on a control.

Before configuring the consoles, your web server must be configured and running.

Configuring the Digital Engagement Administration Console

You can configure proactive chat in the Profiles section of the Console. Each profile or campaign has a Chat configuration tab. Proactive chat is disabled by default. To enable it, click Enable Proactive Chat.

The options that you need depend on the question shown to the customer and the customer’s action:

Choosing Your Chat Console Theme Adding Fields and Customizing Labels Hiding System Fields

Combining Proactive Chat and Standard Chat Five9 does not recommend that you use proactive chat and standard chat on the same page. However, if you choose to do so, follow these steps:

1 Ensure that all your configuration options, such as profiles and showProfiles, are

identical.

223 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

Customizing the Chat Console

2 Add this script to the page:

<script>

var target = document.body;

var observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {

mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {

if (mutation.addedNodes.length && mutation.addedNodes [0].className === 'five9-frame') {

$('#five9-maximize-button').click();

setTimeout(function () {

$('#five9-minimize-icon').click();

}, 500);

}

});

});

var config = { attributes: false, childList: true, characterData: false };

observer.observe(target, config);

</script>

Customizing the Chat Console

The Five9 Chat Console enables you to offer chat conversations to your customers.

Customizing Fields in the Chat Console

Adding Fields and Customizing Labels To make your custom fields required, add the required: true attribute shown below. You can add fields and customize the labels that appear in the chat console, for example:

var fields = { name: {

// Set the label for a system field. label: 'Custom Name'

224 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1215

Customizing the Chat Console

},

// custom fields NewField1: {label: 'New Field 1', required: true}, NewField2: {label: 'New Field 2'} }; Five9SocialWidget.addWidget({

type: 'chat', fields: fields,

... };

Using Variables in the Chat Console You can use variables to enhance the interaction or capture additional information.

Example

When a customer submits a chat request with an account number, you can pass the account number in a connector to a third-party system to present the customer’s account information to the agent.

1 Create a custom chat console field named contact_id as described in the

previous section.

2 To store the new custom field, use the call variable named Omni.contact_id.

For digital engagement interactions, you must use the call variable group named Omni.

3 Configure a connector to pass the value.

For more information about variables, see the Basic Configuration Administrator's Guide.

Customizing Variables and Labels You can create and use custom variables, defined within your JavaScript, using <Call Variable Group>.<Call Variable Name> format. An example defining Global.Customer Entered ANI is shown below.

"fields": {

"Global.Customer Entered ANI": {

"value": "", "show": true, "label": "Phone Number" }

},

Hiding System Fields The system fields for the chat is as follows:

Chat Console email

name

profiles

question

System fields are required. Only profile and email can be hidden. If profile is hidden, the first profile in the list is used. To hide a custom field, use the show property with the value true or false. If the email field is hidden, a generic email value is generated and is sent to the system. This example shows the email field hidden:

var fields = {

email: {

// Hide the email field. show:false } }; Five9SocialWidget.addWidget({

type: 'chat', fields: fields, ... };

226 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1217

Customizing the Chat Console

Using Business Hours Settings You may configure your chat availability to follow your defined business hours. This enables you to offer chat options during a defined schedule. If agents become unavailable during your defined business hours the chats will queue for availability. To enable using business hours, set the useBusinessHours parameter to true in the JavaScript function or directly into the URL query string.

Five9SocialWidget.addWidget({

type: 'chat', rootUrl: '../', tenant: 'tenant', profiles: 'profiles', title: 'title', useBusinessHours: true,

});

Customizing the Chat Tab To customize the chat tab that your customers click to request a chat session with an agent, modify the CSS. The !important declaration enables you to modify the look and feel of the chat window and tab while ensuring that the style is not overwritten with any subsequent style sheet loading.

The example below shows the chat button modified to display a larger font size and the words Chat Now. Place !important at the end of the declaration that you want to customize, just before the semicolon.

<style type='text/css'> .five9-chat-button { font-size: 24px !important; } .five9-chat-button:after { content: 'Chat Now' !important; } #five9-popout-button { float: right;

} </style>

Hiding the Chat Button in the Footer To hide the chat button in the footer, use this CSS:

. five9-frame-minimized { display: none !important;

227 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1218

Customizing the Chat Console

}

Creating a Chat Link Elsewhere on the Page To create a link anywhere else on the page to open Five9 chat, use this function:

<a class="nav-link launchChat" href="#">Chat with Sales</a> <script type="text/javascript">

$(function() {

$('.launchChat').click(function(event) {

$('#five9-maximize-button').trigger('click'); event.preventDefault(); }); }); </script>

Adding a Survey Comments Field You can require or show survey comments by adding surveyOptions to the function, for example:

Five9SocialWidget.addWidget({

type: 'chat', /* [... other options], */ surveyOptions: {

showComment: false, // Default true requireComment: true // Default false } });

Hiding the Five9 Information You can hide the Five9 information (Provided by Five9) at the bottom of the chat console with a custom style element:

/* Hide provider link */ .provider, .provider:hover, .provider:focus, .provider-text {

cursor: default !important; display: none !important; }

This snippet is included in the CSS example in the archive that you downloaded (Five9 Consoles Examples\Chat\CSS).

Customizing the Chat Console

You may also hide the information by deleting the S_PROVIDER string in your custom language file.

Adding a Custom Language File to the Chat Console This feature does not apply to proactive chat. You can customize the language of the text in the chat console window by adding the lang option to the chat widget script. To add a custom language file for your chat console implementation, add the URL of a custom language file that you are hosting. The graphic below shows a Spanish language custom language file.

Example

Custom language files:

l English custom language file

l Spanish custom language file

Chat Transcript Localization

While the classic chat console can be localized in any language by uploading a language file, the transcript for the conversation is supported only in the languages that Five9 supports. You can add UserLocale CAV under fields that allows you to change the language of the transcript sent to the recipient. The script generator also allows you to

Integrating Chat in Your Website

This section guides you through adding a chat console to your website. It includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript to be inserted into each HTML page where you want to offer chat functionality to your customers. The chat console supports a single profile for each webpage. Ensure your web server is configured and running before setting up the chat console.

230 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1221

Customizing the Chat Console

Allowing Multiple Active Chats/Emails You can allow multiple active chats and emails at the same time in the same browser by using a namespace parameter. The parameter makes the session unique allowing multiple instances. To use a namespace parameter, add the value in the Javascript function as shown:

Five9SocialWidget.addWidget({

type: 'chat', rootUrl: '../', tenant: 'tenant', profiles: 'profiles', title: 'title', namespace: 'Mynamespace', });

Adding Google Analytics Support Zero-configuration option is not compatible with Internet Explorer version 11.

Five9 Social widget and Five9 proactive chat can be zero-configuration. If you are using Google’s most recent method of adding Google Analytics scripts to your page, Five9 scripts detect and retrieve your Google Analytics ID dynamically. Five9 proactive chat is embedded in your web page and has no configuration option. Proactive chat sends events if the function gtag is available to send events.

Additional configuration may be required for legacy implementations. In this case, you must add the Google Analytics ID, or gaid, to your chat or proactive chat script.

Adding the Social Widget Script The Five9 Social widget uses inline CSS. Add this script to the <head> tag of the HTML pages:

<script src='https://app.five9.com/consoles/SocialWidget/five9- social-widget.min.js'></script>

Opening Chat in a New Window This JavaScript function assembles the url for the chat window based upon the values in the Config json object and then opens the window.

function onOpenChatLink(){ var rootUrl = Config.rootUrl + 'ChatConsole'; var

## Page 1222

Customizing the Chat Console

url = rootUrl;var elementCounter = 0;

for (var key in Config) {

url = url + (elementCounter++ === 0 ? '?' : '&'); if (Config.hasOwnProperty(key)) { url = url + key + '=' + Config[key]; } } var chatUrl = encodeURI(url); var props = 'width=350,height=550,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=no ,status=no,titlebar=no,toolbar=no'; window.open(chatUrl, 'Five9Chat', props) = 'width=350,height=550,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=no ,status=no,titlebar=no,toolbar=no';window.open (chatUrl,'Five9Chat',props)

Adding the Script Tag in the <head> Section An alternative to defining the Config JSON object in the page is to put it in its own .js file and include it in a script tag in the <head> section, description shown below:

Note

The code snippet above represents the contents of the JavaScript file that you are linking with the script tag in the head. This snippet is not actual content to be pasted into the <head> section.

// <script src="<URL of config.js file>"><script> var Config = {

// type is 'chat' or 'email' type: "chat",

// rootUrl is always as shown below rootUrl: "https://app.five9.com/consoles/",

// tenant is your Five9 Domain name tenant: "<Your Domain Name Goes Here>",

// profiles or profiles that applies to the chat session profiles: "Chat - Customer Support",

// title of the chat window title: "Custom Chat Title",

// theme - There are 3 theme files available from Five9, or it may point to your own custom CSS file theme: "default-theme.css", //theme: "lime-time.css",

//theme: "flagship.css", fields: {},

// showProfiles controls whether a dropdown appears for the cus- tomer to choose from - If only 1 profile is listed under profiles this option is best left as 'false' showProfiles: false };

Adding the Consoles Script Add this script at the bottom of the <body> tag of the HTML pages. The script contains the required and optional parameters to use the chat and email consoles:

<script> Five9SocialWidget.addWidget({

type: 'chat', rootUrl: 'https://app.five9.com/consoles/', tenant: 'MyTenantName', title: 'My Company Name', profiles: ['Questions and Concerns','Sales'], showProfiles: true, enableCallback: true, callbaclList: callback_list, theme: 'default-theme.css' }); </script>

Important

If you are installing basic chat on sites built with Wordpress, you must use the Wordpress Insert Headers and Footers plug-in, available at WordPress.org, to add the following Five9 Social Widget header and footer code.

Header Code:

<script src="https://app.five9.com/consoles/SocialWidget/five9-social- widget.min.js"></script>

Footer Code: The footer code must contain the contents of the .txt file. If you are implementing chat on a site built using WordPress, you can use the Five9 WordPress plug-in to implement Five9 chat without JavaScript.

Configuring SMS Interactions

Five9 SMS messaging is configured as a chat interaction and uses the Five9 chat console interface to distribute these messages to your agents. To use SMS messaging for your contact center, you must have the following features enabled:

l Five9 Chat

l Five9 Messaging

l SMS DNIS available for campaigns

236 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1227

Configuring SMS Interactions

For any questions about these features for your contact center, contact your Five9 representative.

You must configure the SMS messaging options (see Configuring Chat Setting and Transcript Options).

SMS interactions arrive with the contact phone number and SMS question identified and are ready for interaction routing.

Note: Five9 creates a contact record for SMS interactions that are received by Five9 without an existing contact record. In this instance, the name and email fields are populated with <PhoneNumber>@anonymous.com. Example:9255551212@anonymous.com.

Alphanumeric & Shortcodes

Shortcodes, typically five to six digits long, allow for direct customer engagement through SMS or MMS, enabling significantly higher messaging volumes in shorter durations compared to standard long codes or Toll-Free Numbers (TFNs). At Five9, Shortcodes are currently limited to the US.

Shortcodes are designed for high-throughput messaging, such as programmatic or broadcast communications, with default capacities reaching up to 100 messages per second. They are tailored for specific use cases and can serve as an effective alternative to long codes when facing carrier-imposed restrictions on message delivery.

Common use cases for Shortcodes include system or account alert notifications, promotional or marketing alerts, two-factor authentication (2FA) or one-time passwords, and reminders for upcoming payments or appointments.

Shortcodes are designated for messaging within the specific countries they're provisioned for. Therefore, a US Shortcode wouldn't be suitable if your audience isn't in the US. Additionally, Shortcodes require explicit user consent for SMS messaging; usage without consent is prohibited.

There are restrictions on the type of content and campaigns allowed via Shortcodes, as determined by Five9 and carriers. Prohibited uses include campaigns without verifiable user consent, adult content, lead generation-only services, and messaging for multiple financial entities. It's essential for a single entity to manage any campaign to maintain control over message content and frequency.

237 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1228

Configuring SMS Interactions

While certain use cases like age-restricted content and direct lender services are permitted, they're subject to additional carrier requirements and may encounter delays in provisioning.

Certain campaigns are not supported by Five9 and/or carriers, such as those unable to obtain explicit end-user consent, containing sexual/adult content, solely aimed at lead generation or data collection, or representing multiple financial institutions. Additionally, Shortcode messaging campaigns must be managed by a single entity to ensure consistency in message content and delivery frequency.

Allowed use cases include age-restricted content (Tobacco, Alcohol, etc.), sweepstakes or contests, and loan-related use cases for direct lenders. However, they may undergo additional scrutiny and take longer than usual to provision.

Shortcodes are provisioned through the Admin Console and anchored to numbering definitions. The Five9 provisioning team handles Shortcode provisioning after the registration process is completed. Please refer to the registration requirement section to understand what's necessary to register for a Shortcode number. Once the numbers are provisioned, corresponding permissions must be enabled for them to be accessible in the Admin Console.

Update Campaigns Users with edit permissions can update the campaigns associated with Shortcodes by clicking on the corresponding enabled number. Once the campaigns have been associated, users can see a validation mark against the Shortcode number if the campaign is assigned to the number.

Application Requirements Application requirements to enable Shortcodes:

l The short code registration process begins with updating an application.

Organizations must provide the following crucial information to proceed with the application:

o Example messages of the actual messages that will be sent through the

Shortcode.

o The SMS program brand’s website must be live before carriers will review

the Shortcode application.

l A visual representation of the end-user consent process showcasing the call to

action for users to sign up and receive messages via the Shortcode. This mockup must adhere to specific criteria detailing what information must be presented to

243 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1234

Configuring SMS Interactions

users before obtaining their consent for message receipt from a Shortcode. Failure to incorporate these mandatory elements will result in carriers rejecting the consent flow.

l A letter of authorization from the brand appearing in your messaging.

l A compliant screenshot, link, or mockup of the SMS Terms of Service is required.

While these terms do not need to be actively published on your website during the application process, a draft must be submitted for carrier approval of the Shortcode program. Ensure that the SMS Terms URL is activated before the launch of the Shortcode program.

Once the application is submitted, Five9’s internal review of the submitted materials will take a week. It will then be sent to carriers for approval through our integrator. Major carriers take about six to ten weeks to approve. Please note, approvals are subject to carrier discretion, and approval may take longer based on the use case and industry.

Upon approval, it is essential to configure your Shortcode to acknowledge and respond to the mandatory compliance keywords HELP and STOP. Additionally, you must incorporate an effective blacklist mechanism to handle STOP requests appropriately.

Regulations Applicable Regulations applicable for Shortcodes:

l Five9 will not approve Shortcode applications that do not comply with our

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

l Customers are required to adhere to the regulations set forth by the Telephone

Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).

l Before forwarding applications to carriers for review, Five9's providers conduct

their compliance assessments. These providers may enforce their policies, which, while generally in agreement with carrier standards, dictate what they will accept or decline for submission.

l The CTIA, a carrier trade association, mandates specific guidelines for Shortcode

campaigns as outlined in the CTIA Shortcode Compliance Handbook.

l It's important to note that carriers reserve the right to approve or reject any use

case on their network, regardless of whether all stipulated requirements have been satisfied.

SMS Options

Opt-in/Opt-out Regulation U.S. regulatory and telecommunication industry rules governing businesses and organizations' use of SMS to communicate with Consumers ensure that they only receive SMS communications they want to receive from businesses or organizations.

SMS consumers should have a transparent opt-in/opt-out mechanism. Consumers must consent to all recurring messages; entering a mobile phone number does not necessarily constitute a compliant opt-in. For these reasons, Organizations sending SMS to consumers need to provide an option for Consumers to opt-in. It then needs to follow up by sending a confirmation message to the user. For recurring message programs, confirmation messages must include clear opt-out instructions. Messages should also remind consumers from time to time that they are still enrolled – This is a recommended process to sign-up Consumers for regulatory Opt-in/Opt-out SMS features.

Blocking Objectionable Content You may have set up a method to report spam and objectionable content. Five9 does not filter the media for unwanted or disallowed content, such as SHAFT. SHAFT is an acronym for sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco. SHAFT guidelines should be taken seriously by any businesses communicating with their customers to ensure that they comply with Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association (CTIA) guidelines. Any messages that contain prohibited content are likely to be blocked by carriers. For more information, see CTIA.

Note

For more information about CTIA Messaging Principles and Best Practices concerning SMS, see Section 5.1 Consumer Content in Non-Con- sumer (A2P) Best Practices

SMS Attachments Users can submit attachments to their SMS. However, for the SMS attachments file name, Five9 only supports lowercase and uppercase ASCII letters, decimal digits, "!", "*", "+", "-", "/", "=", and "_".

An agent can only send an attachment if they have the User can send messaging attachments permission selected on the Roles: Permission dialog.

Each major carrier in the US has an MMS message file size limit:

l AT&T: 1 MB

l Verizon: 1.2 MB

l Sprint: 2 MB

l T-Mobile: 1 MB

Note

The file sizes above will generally be passed along to the wireless car- riers. However, due to the differences in handsets, file types, and transcoding, Five9 recommends you send attachments no larger than 500KB to ensure the best chance of delivery. Also, unlike other media types, the maximum .txt file size supported is 64KB per attachment.

Supported SMS Attachment File Types The most widely supported attachment types are jpeg, png, and gif images. Five9 accepts all SMS content types on the list below, but delivery is not guaranteed since downstream carriers and handsets may have limitations on what types of files they accept.

SMS Segmentation and Billing SMS usage billing is based on the number of segments in a message. SMS service providers segment SMS messages based on the number of characters in a message, and count each segment within a message as a single unit. If an SMS message contains 200 characters, it is counted as two SMS messages: one containing 160 characters (maximum per segment), and one containing 40 characters. Character encoding type affects how the number of characters are counted. A message containing special (Unicode or non-GSM) characters are counted as additional segments. For example, the following message contains 206 characters and is billed as four segments.

"Name, you are considering school, that’s great! We will reach out to you later from this phone number (4087897938) to discuss more about our University. Our next start date is right around the corner!".

The apostrophe in “that’s” and the two parentheses in “(4087897938)” result in the additional segments.

The number of segments in your messages may impact your billing. Contact your account team for more information.

Keywords

A keyword is a unique word or phrase that customers or subscribers can send to your 10DLC, TFN, or short code number to subscribe or unsubscribe from future text messages. You can create multiple keyword definitions to suit different purposes.

1 Ensure that you have the required permissions.

2 Select the Keywords card or the Manage Contacts and Lists icon in the sidebar

navigation.

3 On the Keyword Management page, select Create.

4 If required, toggle Default for Domain to apply the keyword definition across the

entire domain.

5 Select the Opt-In Category.

6 Enter the relevant keywords, such as "YES," "IN," or other business-specific

terms. Customize these keywords in multiple languages with Opt-In messages tailored to your customers.

The Opt-In Keyword definition allows administrators to specify how consumers can give their consent. Methods include:

o Customer Relationship: Use an existing customer relationship to qualify

for opt-in based on prior consent.

o Verbal Consent: Obtain consumer consent verbally, either through an

agent or an IVR system.

o Web Form: Collect consent when consumers provide their phone number

on your business website.

o Public Source: Use a consumer's number obtained from a public source

where it was freely provided.

o Point-of-Sale (POS) Signup: Allow consumers to sign up for messages

through an on-site POS system or other message senders.

o Advertising Keyword: Enable consumers to opt in by sending an

advertising keyword to your company.

7 Create the Opt-In Message that consumers will receive after subscribing. Ensure

the response includes your brand name, confirmation of the subscription,

instructions for seeking help, and clear instructions on how to unsubscribe (Opt- Out).

8 Enter the Confirmation Message that confirms the recipient's choice. Examples

include:

o "You are now subscribed to [Company-Name]. Message frequency varies.

To get help, reply HELP. To unsubscribe, reply STOP."

o "Welcome to [Company-Name]. You will start receiving text messages. For

assistance, reply HELP. To unsubscribe, reply STOP."

o "[Company-Name]: Reply YES to subscribe to mobile alerts. You will

receive periodic messages. Text HELP for help. Text STOP to unsubscribe."

Note

After receiving a message, recipients can respond with one of three text commands: STOP, UNSTOP, or HELP. Note that these commands do not apply to Toll-Free Numbers (TFNs).

Creating Help Keywords When users respond with the HELP command, they receive an automated message with the main contact number for further assistance. You can customize this message to fit your organization’s needs.

HELP keywords should generally provide useful information, such as how to opt out. If you customize the HELP message, we recommend including your business name in the response.

To create a new Help keyword:

1 Ensure that you have the required permissions.

2 Select the Keywords card or the Manage Contacts and Lists icon in the sidebar

navigation.

response to the HELP command. Examples include:

o "This is [Org Name]. If you have any questions, please visit our website.

For further assistance, type HELP. Send STOP to unsubscribe.

Responses

Unstop

Customers who change their minds and want to opt in again can reply with the UNSTOP message. This opts them back in to receive messages from your organization, allowing you to send messages again.

Note

Standard messaging fees apply to the initial inbound STOP, START, HELP, or INFO message sent to your Five9 number, just like any other inbound SMS message. However, there are no additional fees for the blocklist changes triggered by these keywords, and no cost for the automatic reply to the sender.

Notice

Text message campaigns may be subject to various legal compliance requirements based on the nature of your campaign, the origin of your text messages, and the location of your recipients. While Five9 manages the messages described on long codes and Toll-Free numbers outlined in this article, you should consult your legal counsel to ensure your campaign complies with all applicable legal requirements. For further questions, please contact Five9 Support.

Broadcast SMS Panel

The Broadcast SMS Panel allows you to monitor the status of your broadcast messages. By selecting a specific broadcast from the list on the SMS Broadcasts page, you can review the delivery status of messages, including those that have been successfully delivered or failed. This feature provides a comprehensive overview, enabling you to track the performance of your SMS campaigns.

Delivered: Monitors the delivery status of SMS messages to ensure they reach intended recipients. These metrics are crucial for organizations to verify successful message delivery.

Scheduled: Shows the number of messages scheduled for sending at a specified date and time.

Sent: Represents the total number of messages initiated via our SEND SMS API. This metric indicates the total number of messages sent, not whether they reached end- user devices.

Failed: Indicates the total number of messages that could not be delivered. Reasons include the recipient's phone being off, out of service area, or the number being incorrect or inactive.

Unknown: Represents the total number of SMS messages for which the delivery status is unconfirmed. This may occur due to factors like network disruptions, carrier limitations, or system errors, preventing confirmation of message receipt.

273 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1264

Configuring SMS Interactions

Canceled: Refers to the total number of SMS messages not sent because they were halted or stopped before delivery. This could occur due to sender intervention or system processes, indicating that the message was never delivered to the recipient's device. Resending may be necessary if the message is still required.

Registering SMS 10DLC and TFN

US Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have implemented policies to decrease spam and phishing application-to-person (A2P) messages sent from 10DLC numbers. To comply with these policies, you must register your SMS-enabled numbers with a central registration system. This process varies depending on the type of your SMS-enabled numbers. There are two types of SMS-enabled numbers:

l 10DLC is a 10-digit long code that allows businesses to send messages to

customers through standard (local) phone numbers.

l TFN is a 10-digit toll-free number that begins with an 800, 888, 877, 866, 855,

844, or 833 area code, and allows businesses to send messages to customers through national numbers.

This content guides you through Five9's 10DLC brands and campaigns (use cases) registration process in Administrator Console (Admin Console). You must register TFN separately. See Toll-Free Verification for details and FAQs on TFN registration.

Note

The content in this topic refers to use case campaigns, which are not associated with VCC configured campaigns.

To register your 10DLC SMS-enabled numbers in Admin Console, you need to follow Creating a 10DLC Brand Creating a 10DLC Campaign, and then associate the brand with the campaign. A 10DLC brand is the entity from which you are sending the SMS. Brand registration is required for compliance and is usually done per EIN. A 10DLC campaign is based on the standard or special type use case of messages you are sending.

Five9 Admin Console Permissions Permissions and permission sets in the Admin Console, allow you to control the functions or features users can perform. To configure 10DLC brands and campaigns, you must have the required campaign management registry permissions in the Five9 Admin Console. While editing a user record in Admin Console, go to Permissions > All

Important

Five9 does not recommend sending shared attachments with personally identifiable information (PII) data. Any attachment with PII should be attached directly to only one contact. If you choose to send an attach- ment with PII data to multiple users, the compliance responsibility for the California Consumer Privacy Act (CaCPA) and the General Data Pro- tection Regulation (GDPR) is your responsibility to address. Five9 will only purge attachments that are related to a single user. If you use an attachment to send to multiple users when we purge for one of the users then that shared attachment will also be purged.

Configuring Email Interactions

When customers send email messages, they click a link in your corporate Web site. You define the email account to direct incoming email messages for the profile. The fields for incoming and outgoing email accounts may differ.

For information about customizing the email console, see Customizing the Email Console.

Important

Agent Desktop Plus and the Five9 CRM adapters support inbound email attachments of up to 25 MB. However, in Microsoft Outlook the email message itself is about 2.5 MB, so with Microsoft Outlook the effective maximum attachment size is 22.5 MB. Outbound email interaction attachments are limited to 10MB in size and have no file type constraints.

Preparing Your Environment

Five9 supports POP3 and IMAP connectivity protocols. You can use accounts that allow direct access from an on-premise exchange email account or Office 365 without enabling using the IMAP and SMTP protocols. Follow these recommendations:

l If your mail server is behind a firewall, always obtain OWA or other access to

test a mail client and connectivity to target accounts.

l If you want to use a cloud-based mail provider to forward and/or redirect email

to your on-premise mail server, ensure that the intended email address remains intact when an external recipient attempts to reply to an email sent by an agent.

All inbound emailis deleted from your email server's inbox once email is enabled for Five9. To keep a copy of these email interactions, enable Save Original Inbound Email (see Save Original Inbound Email: Creates a new folder to store a copy of processed emails. ).

Important

Before configuring email, create a contact field labeled email and of data type Email.

Email Signature

Email Signature by Campaign allows customers to maintain brand alignment and consistency across all outbound email communication. Administrators can define signatures at the campaign level, ensuring:

l Brand alignment and consistency are maintained.

l Promotions can be easily added to campaigns, facilitating connections for sales,

customer service, and more.

The signature specified for a campaign will be automatically included in every new and outbound email. Agents can view the campaign signature, but they cannot edit or remove it.

Updating the Email Signature

1 Select Manage Campaigns and then the campaign.

2 Select Email Signature.

3 Upload your email signature and select Save.

Note

The system scans inline campaign signature content for unsafe HTML and malware

314 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1305

Configuring Email Interactions

Note: The signature can include branding, promotions, contact information, links, images, and text. A campaign signature may contain up to 5300 characters, plus up to 16 attachments.

To remove the email signature, select the Remove Signature button at the bottom of the window.

Previewing Email Signatures Your administrator can configure an email signature for each campaign. If a signature is defined at the campaign level, it appears below the personal signature when a new outbound email or reply is delivered to the recipient. It doesn't appear in the email editor. The signature can include, for example, branding, promotions, contact information, links, images, and text.

If a signature is defined for a campaign, you can preview it when composing an outbound email. To preview the signature, click Campaign Signature at the bottom of the email page.

Park Email

This feature allows agents to park email interactions while they are waiting for additional information, or are otherwise unable to respond to the email interactions immediately. Parked email interactions do not count toward an agent's email capacity. Being able to park emails, allows agents to work full capacity on other email interactions.

315 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1306

Configuring Email Interactions

You can allow agents to park email interactions for a specific or unlimited duration. If the park duration expires, the agent receives a notification within the agent application. This notification allows them to unpark the email interaction or take other actions as needed. It is essential for the agent to manage their capacity before they can proceed with unparking or any related tasks.

Configuring Parked Email Interaction Limits

1 Select Users and then select the user's name.

2 Select App & Channels and then Edit.

If you do not see Emails and Parked Emails listed under Media Channels, select Add and then select Emails.

3 Use the up and down arrows in Parked Emails to specify the number of email

interactions you want the user to be able to park. The capacity of Parked Emails cannot exceed the number of Emails.

Important

For email parking to function properly, it's essential to define open dispositions for the campaign in the Admin Console.

Configuring the Parked Email Interaction Duration Per Domain

1 Parked email duration can be configured for all campaigns in the domain under

Manage Environment > Interaction Settings > Interactions.

316 Digital Engagement • Administrator’s Guide

2 To allow users to park email interactions with no limit on duration, select Emails

should be parked for an unlimited amount of time. If you want to set a limit on the duration, select Emails should be parked for a limited amount of time, then specify the desired duration in days, hours, and minutes using the up and down arrows. By default, the timer for email parking is set not to expire. Administrators must actively set a duration if they wish for email parking to have an expiration.

Note

Park duration settings apply to all campaigns for the domain.

Five9 Engagement Workflow can help to determine if an email is spam and automatically set a disposition the interaction without routing to an agent. You can use attributes or custom call variables to store email interaction header information and use Five9 Engagement Workflow to parse the headers and determine actions and routing for the email.

Routing or Segmentation Use Cases. Determine if the incoming email is a new interaction or a reply to an existing email thread. Within the email replies, determine which email thread this response references and route the email or apply actions using the Five9 Rules Engine.

Routing Replies to Marketing Campaigns. You can route email replies to support cases separately from email interactions that are replies to marketing campaigns. Use the reply-to field to identify the previous reply by an agent in the Five9 Rules Engine and expose this new rule to route the email to a skill or agent.

For more information about using the Five9 Rules Engine, see Configuring Your Five9 Rules.

Saving Original Inbound Messages

When the Five9 email proxy polls an account email a new folder is automatically created This folder, Five9Processed_<CampaignName>, receives a copy of each email interaction. This process ensures that a copy of each email retained for future reference after emails are processed and deleted. You can control this setting in your SCC Administrator console. See Save Original Inbound Email for more information.

Note

The POP3 protocol does not support saving processed or unprocessed messages.

If Five9 cannot process an email, it will either keep the email in the inbox for a later retry or move it to the Five9Processed_<CampaignName> folder.

As an alternative to using the Save Original Inbound Email feature, or if you choose to continue using POP3 protocol, to retain the original email messages, create a rule to copy and move to a backup location all email from the account connected to the profile. For instructions about creating the rule, refer to your email server documentation and consult your IT administrator.

Creating Email Accounts

You can create accounts for Microsoft and other exchanges in the Email option of your profile.

Gmail Account New Gmail accounts use basic authentication and require additional configuration for Five9 to pull email interactions from your Gmail account. To complete your Gmail configuration, see sign in with app passwords.

Google may require an additional step when signing into a new application. If you receive an email from Google about a critical security alert, see unblock Five9 from consuming email from your Gmail account.

If you use Outlook Exchange, a Five9 Manual folder is automatically created to store messages that are malformed or contain bad header information, which the Five9 email proxy is unable to process. The URL for this folder contains the server address followed by /EWS/Exchange.asmx.

Example

https://mail.<yourDomain>.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx

To ensure that the mail administrator can monitor this folder when items are delivered, Five9 recommends that you create an alert in your mail server. These malformed messages must be processed manually.

Configuring OAuth2 for Office 365 Exchange Server Microsoft is ending support for Basic authorization for Office 365 Exchange Server. Therefore, if you have accounts that use basic authorization, you are required to upgrade to OAuth2. If you select the POPS, IMAPS, or Exchange protocol and Office 365 Exchange Server, you can assign OAuth2 authentication for email interactions.

Using Single Sign-On with Five9 Applications

Single sign-on enables you to synchronize authentication and authorization data between your application and Five9 so that users can access both systems simultaneously:

l If you enable single sign-on, your agents use only one set of credentials to

automatically log into the adapter when they log into your application.

l If you do not enable single sign-on, your agents must use two sets of credentials

to log into your application and Five9 separately.

This guide describes how to configure single sign-on with commonly used identity providers. To determine if your current IT infrastructure can support single sign-on configuration, refer to the Technical Requirements Reference Guide.

Prerequisites Configuration Overview

Prerequisites

Ensure that the following requirements are met before configuring single sign-on. Contact your Five9 support representative for more information.

Ensure that your domain is enabled for Five9 Plus applications.

Five9 supports identity providers that adhere to the SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) specification. For example, these identity and CRM providers function with Five9 applications: Okta, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services, Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Salesforce, Oracle Service Cloud, Auth0, OneLogin, and Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).

6 Single Sign-On • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1336

Using Single Sign-On with Five9 Applications

Configuration Overview

You may configure and simultaneously use multiple identity providers in each domain. To enable identity providers to recognize users, you must assign a unique Federation ID to each user in the user's properties on the VCC Administrator application.

Configuration Overview

1 Install and configure the basic identity provider features, noting the server’s

domain name. 2 Configure single sign-on in the identity provider application. 3 Configure single sign-on in the VCC application. 4 Verify your single sign-on configuration.

Five9 Domains and Application Short Names

During the single sign-on configuration, you need to provide URLs that include your Five9 domain and the short name that Five9 uses for your CRM application.

Individual configuration tasks require specific URL formats, but generally use this format where you substitute <five9_domain> with your Five9 domain and <application> with the appropriate application short name.

https://<five9_domain>/appsvcs/saml/SSO/alias/<application>

For example, the following is the identifier URL format to use when you configure SSO for Azure. This URL example is for the Agent Desktop Plus application and the location is the US.

https://app.five9.com/appsvcs/saml/SSO/alias/agent

For SSO configuration tasks that require a similar URL, use the URL format specified in the configuration instructions.

Before you begin the configuration, become familiar with your domain and your application short name.

Five9 Domains Use the domain that applies to your location:

Defining Single Sign-On Identity Providers Configuring Identity Providers

Defining Single Sign-On Identity Providers

For single sign-on, you may configure and simultaneously use multiple identity providers in each domain. To enable users to be recognized by all the identity providers that you configure, you must assign each user a unique Federation ID in their user properties.

In this section, you configure the parameters of your single sign-on providers and certificates.

Configuring Identity Providers

You create, edit, or delete identity providers in the upper section of the Single Sign-On tab in the VCC Administrator application.

Default Name ID Format Format for default Name ID.

4 Click Save.

Deleting an Identity Provider

To delete an identity provider, select that provider from the drop-down list and click Delete IdP.

Configuring Login URLs

A login URL enables your users to use single sign-on credentials managed by a third- party identity provider. Once the connection is configured, you can create SAML single sign-on users who can log into their Five9 account through an identity provider- initiated single sign-on URL. You can populate login URLs for Five9 Plus Adapter for Salesforce, Five9 Plus Adapter for ServiceNow, Five9 Plus Adapter for Oracle Service Cloud, and Plus Adapter for Agent Desktop Toolkit. For more information about populating the login URL, see the Administrator's Guide for the relevant adapter.

Importing Digital Certificates

The SAML single sign-on feature in Five9 enables you to connect to your identity provider with digital certificates, which provides an additional layer of security beyond user name and password credentials.

To add your digital certificate for configuration, follow these steps.

If you use Agent Desktop Plus or ServiceNow, proceed to Testing Active Directory Single Sign-On.

Agent Desktop Toolkit and NetSuite

Add the login URL of your identity provider host to the browsers that your agents will use. For instructions, see the browser configuration sections in the Administrator’s guide.

Microsoft Dynamics 365

Add your identity provider host to the Five9 integration solution. To do so, enter the URL that you copied in the previous section in the identity provider Login URL field of the Five9 Configuration page of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 application.

Oracle Service Cloud

During the installation of the Five9 Plus adapter, add the login URL of the identity provider. For example: https://<IdPhost>/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx. <IdPhost> is the location of AD FS.

28 Single Sign-On • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1358

Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services

Testing Active Directory Single Sign-On

Due to a browser limitation with the Five9 adapter in Oracle Service Cloud, cookies obtained during a previous authentication with the identity provider are not available when the identity provider-initiated link is executed inside Oracle Service Cloud. This forces agents to enter their identity provider credentials every time they log in to Five9. Therefore, Five9 recommends that you configure Microsoft Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to avoid this issue.

You can test single sign-on only after you have added the identity provider login URL to the Server Configuration Properties in the Add-In Manager page of your Oracle Service Cloud interface. For more information, see the section Editing the Properties of Your Add-In in the Administrator’s guide.

Zendesk

During the installation of the Five9 Plus adapter, add the login URL of the identity provider. For example: https://<IdPhost>/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx. <IdPhost> is the location of AD FS.

Testing Active Directory Single Sign-On

When single sign-on is configured, an additional login button labeled SSO Login is displayed below the standard login button in the agents’ softphone.

1 Log out of the adapter and your CRM application.

Creating a Domain Name

This section describes how to create a Salesforce domain if you do not already have one. You may use any domain name that you currently have in Salesforce, or you can create a domain name now. This domain name is not related to your Five9 domain name. When single sign-on is configured, your users can log into the domain.

When the domain name is accepted, you receive an email from Salesforce. In Salesforce, instead of Step 2 Domain Registration Pending, you now see Step 3 Domain Ready for Testing.

All your application URLs, including those of Visualforce pages, change to the new URL. Therefore, be sure to update any application URLS that were created before you created this domain name.

The login URL for the new domain is in this format: https://<subdomain>.my. salesforce.com/domainname/DomainName.apexp

For Classic, the example login URL for the domain is https://infodevtestdomain-dev- ed.my.salesforce.com/domainname/DomainName.apexp.

For Lightning, the example login URL for the domain is https://companytestdomain-dev- ed.my.salesforce.com/domainname/DomainName.apexp.

Requirements

l Request that your domain be enabled for this UC Adapter. For more information,

contact your Five9 representative.

l Before starting, obtain the Zoom administrator credentials that apply to your

implementation.

l Obtain or configure a Five9 Administrator Console administrator user with at

least the uc.uc.Access UC Panel permission.

Creating a User as a Service Account

Currently, a Zoom administrator can install or add the Zoom UC adapter from the Zoom App Marketplace. However, issues arise when the admin changes their password, enables multifactor authentication, or no longer has the admin role. These issues result in an invalid grant or invalid access token.

To avoid the issue, you can create a dedicated Zoom user as a service account for authorizing the adapter.

7 UC Adapters • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1426

Zoom Phone

Creating a User as a Service Account

Note

Creating a user as a service account is optional. You can use a regular admin user to grant consent for the Five9 UC adapter app and it does not affect the integration capabilities and features. However, when there is a change to the regular admin user, you need to register the Five9 UC adapter again to fix the token error. The error should display for the adapter's status in Admin Console when it occurs.

To create a new role and a new user in Zoom Phone for the Zoom UC adapter:

1 In Zoom Phone, go to User Management > Roles and add a new role. For

example, use the role name AdminUC and the description For authorizing Five9 Adapter.

2 Go to Role Settings and enable the following settings for the newly added role:

Setting Set to

User and Permission Management > Users View and Edit

User and Permission Management > Contacts View

Advanced Features > Marketplace View and Edit

Zoom Phone > Phone Management View

3 Click Save.

4 Create a new Zoom user, following your company password guidelines. The user

should not belong to any group or department so that it won't appear in the Five9 address book. It's best to set the user password to never expire and not to enable multifactor authentication for the user.

5 Add the newly created user as a member of the newly added role.

6 Activate the user as instructed in the activation email, and use the new user

account to log in to Zoom App Marketplace. Add the Five9 adapter as described in Installing the Application from Zoom App Marketplace.

7 If the Add button is unavailable, add the user to the list of users who can add the

Enabling the Zoom Adapter in Multiple Five9 Domains

Enabling the Zoom Adapter in Multiple Five9 Domains

This section describes enabling the adapter for each Five9 domain for a single Zoom account (known as Zoom Tenant).

l Enabling domains

Use a separate Zoom admin credential and Five9 Administrator Console credential for each Zoom authorization step. Only use Zoom admin credentials for one Five9 domain. For example, to enable two Five9 domains on a single Zoom account, use your Zoom-admin1 account and Zoom-admin1 credentials for the first Five9 domain, and Zoom-admin2 account and Zoom- admin2 credentials for the second Five9 domain. Use this method for all Five9 domains in your environment.

l Admin Console changes for the adapter

o Configure Admin Console parameters for each Five9 domain separately.

o Each Five9 domain Admin Console configuration can use a different group

filter setting.

For example, in Five9 Domain1 you can choose to only display Zoom contacts in the agent address book for Zoom departments Dept1 and Dept2, and in Five9 Domain2 only display Zoom contacts for Zoom departments Dept3 and Dept4.

l Capacity

o The maximum number of UC contacts you can import into the Five9

address book is 22,000 for each Five9 domain.

o Use the group filter setting to limit the number of contacts in the address

book.

l Zoom app permissions for admins

o Select All users on this account when setting up the app in the Zoom App

Marketplace to ensure that all Zoom admins can enable the Five9 adapter.

Microsoft Teams

This section describes how to prepare your implementation to use the Five9 UC Adapter for Microsoft Teams so that Five9 agents can see the presence of Microsoft Teams contacts and call them.

Before starting, ensure that you have your Microsoft Teams credentials and the domain provided by your Microsoft vendor (such as, example.com).

Licensing Requirements Creating a User as a Service Account Registering an Application in Microsoft Azure Enabling and Configuring Microsoft Teams in Admin Console About Teams Contacts and Groups Using Teams Resource Accounts for Call Queues and Auto Attendants Enabling the Adapter in Multiple Five9 Domains Configuring SIP Trunk for Microsoft Teams

Licensing Requirements

The Five9 Teams adapter only imports Microsoft Teams users with assigned Microsoft 365 licenses, such as E1, E3, or E5. The adapter filters out users without one of the licenses.

If you plan to enable the Teams Telephony Connect option or Direct Routing for the adapter, the Microsoft Phone System license is also required for the Teams users who need to be imported into the Five9 address book.

Note

You can purchase the Microsoft Phone System license as an add-on if it is not included in the Microsoft 365 license bundle.

Creating a User as a Service Account

Other Requirements

l Request that your domain be enabled for this UC adapter. For more information,

contact your Five9 representative.

l Obtain or configure an Admin Console administrator account with at least the

uc.uc.Access UC Panel permission.

Group Subset Permission Description

uc uc Access Access Unified Communications in Admin Console.

l The admin in your organization (not Five9 personnel) must register the app. The

admin must have a Microsoft Teams account with the Global Administrator role or a privileged administrator role such as Application Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator for granting consent for the Five9 UC adapter.

Creating a User as a Service Account

The Five9 UC Adapter for Microsoft Teams uses the Microsoft Identity platform and OAuth 2.0 auth code flow. The adapter fetches MS Teams contacts and presence statuses via the MS Teams application, using delegated permissions on behalf of the user account who has one of these three roles:

l Global Administrator

l Application Administrator

l Cloud Application Administrator

The adapter requires a valid access token. When the admin user's credentials change or the organization's authentication method (multifactor authentication, for example) changes, the access token isn't renewable and the contact sync fails with an expired token error.

To prevent the error, you need to use a dedicated admin user for the adapter, also called a user as a service account, and set the password to never expire.

29 UC Adapters • Administrator’s Guide

---

## Page 1448

Microsoft Teams

Creating a User as a Service Account

Note

Creating a user as a service account is an optional step. You can still use a regular admin user for granting consent for the Five9 UC adapter without affecting the integration capabilities and features. However, when there is a change to the regular admin user, you need to register the Five9 UC adapter again to fix the token error. The error should be dis- played for the adapter's status in Administrator Console when it occurs.

To create and manage a user as a service account:

1 Determine a naming convention, such as svc-F9TeamsAdapterConnector. It

must meet complexity requirements (14-character minimum length).

2 Create a regular admin user using the naming convention from the previous

step.

3 Assign the Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Application

Administrator role to the user. The MS Teams adapter requires one of these roles.

4 Exclude the user from any groups.

Note

You do not need to enter a license or phone number for the user.

5 Set the user's password to never expire.

Note

Passwords that never expire are more secure: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/microsoft- 365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations?WT.mc_ id=365AdminCSH_inproduct&view=o365-worldwide#password- expiration-requirements-for-users

There are two ways to set the password to not expire.

o Use Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Follow the instructions in the Microsoft

article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add- users/set-password-to-never-expire?view=o365-worldwide

Registering an Application in Microsoft Azure

This section describes how to use a privileged role admin account or a service account to register the Five9 UC Adapter application in Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

Note

An MS Teams administrator in your organization must perform this step. Five9 can't perform this step for you.

Before performing these steps, check to see if another admin user account is already logged in to the Microsoft admin portal. If so, sign out that user and make sure an intended admin user is available for signing in during the registration process.

1 To initiate the Microsoft app registration process, navigate to

https://uc.five9.net/?vendor=msteams.

2 When prompted to authenticate access to your Five9 administrator application,

enter your Five9 administrator credentials.

If your domain is Europe (EU or UK) or Canada, click the appropriate link in the lower portion of the login page.

Configuring the Group Filters

The group filter feature lets you import a comma-separated list of Teams groups (such as Engineering, Finance, Product Management) into the Five9 address book, and specify how to group them.

For more information about using group filters, see About Teams Contacts and Groups.

It's important to note that:

l Names must exactly match the department names as they appear in the MS

Teams directory.

l Entries are not case-sensitive.

l If this field is left blank, all departments are imported.

l Making changes to the Group Filter list in large directories may take a few

minutes to take effect.

1 Open the UC Adapter: Microsoft TeamsSetup page as described above.

2 Under Group filters, select either No group filters or Manual entry.

This grouping option is only for configuring how to group and display contacts in the address book. It doesn't affect the process of importing contacts.

5 Click Save and confirm your changes.

Note

For large enterprises with thousands of contacts, changes to the Group filter parameter may take up to 20 minutes to process. Until the changes are fully processed, the address book will not reflect the changes.

About Teams Contacts and Groups

The Five9 Teams UC adapter uses Microsoft Graph APIs to retrieve customer Teams user data and is limited by the kind and rate of data provided by the APIs. The Five9 adapter applies certain filters and limitations before displaying the contact information in the Five9 address book.

For more information about setting the options described here, see Enabling and Configuring Microsoft Teams in Admin Console.

Number of Contacts Supported

The maximum number of contacts supported in the Five9 address book is 22,000. Customers with a larger number of contacts that meet the criteria must use the Group Filter parameter of the adapter configuration to bring the number of contacts in the Five9 address book down to 22,000. Therefore, support of a Microsoft tenant with total number of Teams contacts greater than 22,000 is only possible using a group filter.

Microsoft Teams

About Teams Contacts and Groups

Contacts with Phone Numbers

Teams contacts that count as part of the 22,000 limit must have a valid PSTN dialable number (not an abbreviated extension) assigned to them in the Office Phone or Mobile Phone fields of Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) as shown below. If the Office Phone field contains a valid number, the Mobile Phone field is ignored.

The phone number can be:

l A string of digits, for example: 4089094439

l In area code format, for example: (408) 909-4439

l In E.164 format, for example: +1 408 9094439

The adapter address book does not support Teams contacts with only an extension number.

To see where the Teams adapter imports user phone numbers, view the Users panel in Microsoft Entra ID.

Contacts Belonging to Multiple Groups

It is common for a Teams contact to belong to multiple Teams groups. The Five9 address book only shows such contacts under one of the group by lexicographic order. An agent searching for a particular contact should use the hot search window to search for the contact by name if they do not know which group the contact appears in.

39 UC Adapters • Administrator’s Guide

## Page 1458

Microsoft Teams

About Teams Contacts and Groups

Note

You can create a new Teams group of Office 365 type and assign all the contacts you want to be seen in the Five9 address book to that group and only that group. Then, once you enter the name of the new group in the Group Filter field of the Admin Console adapter configuration, all of those contacts will appear in the Five9 address book.

Supported Teams Group Types

The Group Filter feature is not configured by default. To use the adapter with the Group Filter default option, Teams contacts must belong to at least one Teams group of type Office 365 with the Teams status icon enabled as shown below.

Note

You can create a Teams-enabled group by selecting the option to add Microsoft Teams to your group when creating a new Microsoft 365 type group.

Group Filter Feature Used If you have entered one or more Teams group names in the Group Filter parameter, the group can be any type: Microsoft 365, not Microsoft 365, Teams-enabled or not Teams-enabled, Security Group, or Distribution group.

Group Filter Feature Not used If you do not configure the Group Filter feature, there are a number of limitations that apply to the types of Teams group that will be imported. Any Teams group of type Microsoft 365 that has the Teams Status icon enabled as shown below will be imported.

Note

Group types Distribution and Security, or ones that do not have the Teams Status enabled, will be filtered out. The contacts that belong to such groups will also be filtered out and not count toward the 22,000 limit.

Enabling the Adapter in Multiple Five9 Domains

Enabling the Adapter in Multiple Five9 Domains

Install the MS Teams adapter for each Five9 domain to enable a single Teams account (also known as Teams Tenant) in multiple Five9 domains.

Here are some important considerations:

l Enablement steps

o For each Microsoft Azure authorization step, you can use the same global

MS Teams admin credential to authorize all Five9 domains.

Note

You must use unique Five9 admin credentials for each Five9 domain.

For example, you can use your MS Teams account Teams-admin1 and Five9 admin F9-Domain1 credentials for your Five9-Domain1 enablement. You can also use Teams-admin1 for Five9-Domain2, but you must use your Five9 admin F9-Domain2 credentials. You can use this method for all Five9 domains in your environment.

l Admin Console

o Configure Admin Console parameters for each Five9 domain separately.

o Each Five9 domain Admin Console configuration can use a different group

filter setting.

For example, you can choose in Five9 Domain1 to only display Teams contacts in the agent address book for Teams groups Group1 and Group2, while in Five9 Domain2 only display Teams contacts for Teams groups Group2 and Group4.

l Capacity considerations

o The maximum number of UC contacts you can import into the Five9

address book is 22,000 across all enabled Five9 domains.

Use the Group Filter setting (above) to limit the number of contacts.

Creating a User as a Service Account

You can resolve these issues by creating a dedicated user as a service account for authorizing the UC adapter.

Note

Creating a user as a service account is optional. You can still use a reg- ular admin user for granting consent for the Five9 UC adapter app without affecting integration capabilities and features. However, when there is a change to the regular admin user, you need to register the Five9 UC adapter again to fix the token error. You should see the token error in the adapter's status in Administrator Console when it occurs.

To create and manage the account:

1 In the RingCentral or Office@Hand admin portal, create a new user with the

following details:

described above.

2 Under Presence Settings, select one of these agent presence options:

o Show agent on Five9 call as 'DND' in RingCentral

When the agent is on a customer call in Five9, their RingCentral or Office@Hand status is DND. If you select this option, it becomes active the next time agents handle a Five9 call.

o Show agent logged into Five9 as 'DND' in RingCentral

When the agent's status is DND in Five9, their RingCentral status is Do Not Disturb. If you select this option, the agent status on RingCentral/Office@Hand shows as Do Not Disturb the next time the agent handles a call or logs in to Five9.
